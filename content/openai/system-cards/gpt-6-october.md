Title: GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna: October 2026 update - OpenAI Deployment Safety Hub

URL Source: https://deploymentsafety.openai.com/gpt-6-october

Markdown Content:
We’re launching GPT-6 to everyone in ChatGPT, across free and paid
plans globally. These models will replace GPT-5.6 Sol and GPT-5.6 Luna
in ChatGPT. Users accessing GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna in Codex, and via
ChatGPT Work, are still using previously released versions. In this
system card, we distinguish these models by their month of release:
October for the versions released today, and September for the versions
that remain in use in Codex and Work. See our blog for
details.

GPT-6 in ChatGPT incorporates Astra’s safety
advances. We also updated the safety training to reflect real-world
use and strengthen protections against high-risk misuse in cyber,
biology, and violence.

We assess safety and alignment evaluations in aggregate, weighing
improvements alongside the nature and severity of regressions. Compared
with GPT-5.6 Sol and GPT-5.6 Luna in ChatGPT, GPT-6 showed stronger
resistance to jailbreaks, including attacks that adapt across multiple
turns, as well as reductions in dishonesty, deception, and circumvention
of guardrails. For areas where our safety evaluations showed
regressions, we conducted manual review of failures and adversarial
red-team testing and found that the disallowed responses were generally
low severity. System-level mitigations to reduce the likelihood of harm
are detailed throughout this system card.

Under our Preparedness Framework, we are treating this October
release of GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna as High capability in both
Cybersecurity and Biological and Chemical domains. Neither one reaches
our High threshold in AI Self-Improvement. Based on that assessment,
we’ve implemented the same set of safeguards for GPT-6 Sol (October) and
GPT-6 Luna (October) that are detailed in the GPT-5.6 System
Card for GPT-5.6 Sol and GPT-5.6 Luna.

For all safety evaluations, such as disallowed content and mental
health, we measure performance of our models at their lowest reasoning
deployment settings in order to capture performance for the vast
majority of usage. For capabilities assessments, we evaluate the models
at their maximum reasoning effort to get an upper bound of
capabilities.

2. Model Data and Training

Like OpenAI’s other models, GPT-6 models were trained on diverse
datasets and filtered through our data processing pipeline, including to
reduce personal information.

OpenAI reasoning models are trained to reason through reinforcement
learning. These models are trained to think before they answer: they can
produce a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user.
Through training, these models learn to refine their thinking process,
try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes. Reasoning allows
these models to follow specific guidelines and model policies we’ve set,
helping them act in line with our safety expectations. This means they
provide more helpful answers and better resist attempts to bypass safety
rules.

For previously launched models, the values published at launch
reflect the versions evaluated at that time. The comparison values for
previously launched models that are shown here may reflect later
versions of those models, and may vary from the values published at
launch.1

3. Model Safety

3.1 Safe Completions

3.1.1 Evaluations with Challenging Prompts

We conducted benchmark evaluations across safety categories. We
report here on our Production Benchmarks, an evaluation set with
conversations representative of challenging examples from production
data. As we noted in previous system cards, we introduced these
Production Benchmarks to help us measure continuing progress given that
earlier Standard evaluations for these categories had become relatively
saturated.

These evaluations were deliberately created to be difficult. They
were built around cases in which our existing models were not yet giving
ideal responses, and this is reflected in the scores below. Error rates
are not representative of average production traffic. The primary metric
is safe completion rate, checking that the model’s response and actions
are not disallowed according to our safety policies. Our evaluations are
run on the model without system-level safeguards to ensure the model’s
underlying behavior meets our safety bar. We continue monitoring these
categories after launch to evaluate online performance and further
adjust safeguards as appropriate.

Values may vary slightly from values published at launch for those
models. Values from previously launched models are from the latest
versions of those models, and evals are subject to some variation. The
comparison scores from earlier models listed below are intended to shed
light on relative performance. Because policies, graders, datasets,
evaluations, and other measurement details evolve over time, scores from
previous system cards not included in the table below should generally
not be considered directly comparable to these most recent results.

Relative to their respective GPT‑5.6 counterparts, GPT‑6 Sol
(October) shows a statistically significant regression on standard
self-harm, while GPT‑6 Luna (October) shows statistically significant
regressions on standard self-harm, gore, and sexual content.

We manually reviewed violative responses from these evaluations and
found that violations were borderline but still generally safe. For
example, GPT‑6 Sol (October) and GPT‑6 Luna (October) are more willing
to answer informational questions about self-harm while directing users
to appropriate professional resources. Based on our evaluations, it does
not comply with requests to facilitate self-harm. GPT‑6 Sol (October)
and GPT‑6 Luna (October) are more likely to engage with requests for
gore and sexual content rather than refuse outright, however the outputs
we reviewed were lower severity. We also conducted adversarial red
teaming and did not identify any high-severity risks based on our
evaluation criteria.

These evaluations do not account for system-level interventions that
elevate the holistic safety of the assistant response, such as Trusted
Contact, localized crisis helplines, and Parental Controls for younger
users.

Table 1: Production Benchmarks with Challenging Prompts (higher is better)

Category

In addition to measuring how safely our models respond to harmful
requests, we assess whether they overrefuse legitimate requests,
especially when a topic is sensitive or easy to misinterpret. In the
Safety Pareto chart below, GPT‑6 Sol (October) and GPT‑6 Luna (October)
show an improvement on helpfulness on legitimate requests relative to
prior models, though it scores lower on some safety requests. Our
evaluations indicate that GPT‑6 Sol (October) and GPT‑6 Luna (October)
are less likely to refuse harmless requests or add excessive or
judgmental caveats.

Figure 1. Safety and non-overrefusal on challenging prompts. Higher is better
on both axes.

3.1.2 Safe Completions for Users Under 18

AI can help teens learn, create, explore ideas, access information,
and build new skills. We design our systems carefully to enable these
benefits while working to mitigate potential risks that may have
outsized or more severe impacts on users under 18 (U18).

Our Model
Spec outlines the principles and requirements that guide how our
models should behave with teens. For users we believe may be under 18,
we operationalize those principles through age-specific provisions in
our safety policies. In some areas where teens may face distinct or
heightened risks, these provisions establish more restrictive thresholds
than those that apply to adults, including for sexual content, emotional
reliance, eating disorders, and access to age-restricted goods and
services. These age-specific safeguards include both model-level
behavior and system-level protections.

We use dedicated U18 evaluations to assess how well the model
performs against these principles across the six categories below. The
evaluations are designed to test whether the model consistently applies
age-appropriate boundaries and avoids providing responses that could
create heightened risks for teens. These evaluations use some of the
most challenging, production-derived examples to assess model behavior
in sensitive contexts, including adversarial examples related to
self-harm, eating disorder-related behaviors, access to age-restricted
goods or services and activities, gore, and inappropriate sexual
content.

Table 2: U18 evaluations (higher is better)

Category

Relative to their respective GPT‑5.6 (August) counterparts, GPT‑6 Sol
(October) and GPT‑6 Luna (October) show statistically significant
regressions on age-restricted content, sexual content, and emotional
reliance. GPT‑6 Luna (October) also shows a statistically significant
regression on gore. The remaining differences are not statistically
significant.

To mitigate the risk of producing disallowed responses for teens, we
apply an additional classifier-based block to responses that may contain
self-harm, sexual content, and gore; this mitigation is not captured in
the evaluation results above and improves safe responses.

We reviewed the regression for emotional reliance and found our
evaluation is overly sensitive to the use of benign nicknames (like
“bro” or “bestie”) by the model, which is not considered disallowed if
explicitly requested by users.

Because these evaluations focus on difficult cases and long-tail
risks, their results should not be interpreted as estimates of how
frequently these behaviors occur in typical production use.

We remain committed to improving how our models support and protect
teens. This includes training models to respond more safely and
appropriately, refining our understanding of teen-safety risks,
strengthening age-appropriate safeguards, and improving how we measure
and report model performance for younger users.

3.2 Vision

We ran the image input evaluations originally introduced with ChatGPT
Agent. These tests use disallowed requests that combine text and images
and measure whether the model’s responses are classified as safe. GPT‑6
Sol (October) and GPT‑6 Luna (October) performed on-par with GPT-5.6 Sol
(August) and GPT-5.6 Luna (August), respectively, except for a
regression on the extremism vision evaluation. We reviewed unsafe
responses from the evaluations and found that their severity was
generally low.

4. Robustness

4.1 Jailbreaks

In this section, we evaluate model robustness to jailbreaks:
adversarial prompts designed to circumvent model refusal training and
elicit harmful assistance. The evaluations here focus on jailbreaking
the main model directly without the safeguards we use in production.
Accordingly, this section only measures one layer of robustness in our
safety stack. We have additional safeguards in production, such as
classifiers, that make it much more difficult for users to jailbreak and
obtain harmful assistance.

4.1.1 Multiturn Jailbreak Evaluations

We also evaluate robustness against adaptive, multiturn attackers
derived from internal red-teaming exercises. Unlike the static
evaluation, these attackers can probe the model, respond to its answers,
and adjust their strategy over multiple turns. Model responses are
scored based on whether they could meaningfully facilitate harmful
requests: harmful assistance receives worse scores, while harmless
responses receive better scores. We report the worst-case defender
success rate as a function of attacker budget: for a budget of n
attempts, the model succeeds only if it avoids unsafe assistance across
all n attacks. This evaluation is particularly challenging at a high
attacker budget where the model needs to be robust to all jailbreak
attempts to be considered successful.

Figure 2

Figure 2. Multiturn jailbreak robustness by attacker budget.

GPT‑6 Sol (October) and GPT‑6 Luna (October) have slightly lower
point estimates than their September counterparts on multi-turn
jailbreak robustness, with broadly overlapping 95% confidence intervals.
Both October models achieve higher observed defender success rates than
GPT‑5.6 Sol at every attacker budget tested.

4.2 Prompt Injection

GPT‑6 Sol (October) and GPT‑6 Luna (October) are highly robust to
prompt injection. We have continued to scale our GPT‑Red
approach, where we use adversarial training with an automated
red-teaming agent to strengthen resistance to malicious instructions
while preserving the ability to complete legitimate tasks.

For our evaluations, we use the GPT‑Red automated evaluations
introduced in the GPT‑5.6
system card. These cover both "direct" prompt injection attacks (or
“instruction hierarchy” violations), where a user attempts to override
higher-priority system or developer instructions, and "indirect"
attacks, where malicious instructions in third-party content attempt to
redirect an agent beyond the user’s request.

GPT-6 Sol (October) and GPT-6 Luna (October) saturate instruction
hierarchy evaluations, achieving 99.99% and 99.79% robustness,
respectively.

Table 4: GPT-RED indirect prompt-injection robustness (higher is better; averaged equally across available reasoning levels).

5. Health

5.1 HealthBench

Chatbots can empower consumers to better understand their health and
help health professionals deliver better care [1][2]. We evaluate GPT-6
Sol and GPT-6 Luna on HealthBench [3], a public evaluation of
health performance and safety, and HealthBench Professional, a public
evaluation of model capability and safety for clinician use cases [4].

We note that HealthBench Professional has been more informative than
older HealthBench variants in our recent evaluations of frontier models.
As an example, improvements in HealthBench Professional have been much
more predictive of improvements in other held-out evaluations in our
internal testing. We believe HealthBench (now more than a year old) is
approaching a noise ceiling for frontier models, and recommend the use
of HealthBench Professional for measuring continued progress at the
frontier. For this system card, we report all variants for
completeness.

Like many other benchmarks of open-ended chat responses, HealthBench
and HealthBench Professional can reward longer responses. Longer answers
may be better when they include additional valuable information, but
they also have more opportunities to satisfy positive rubric criteria,
and unnecessarily long responses can be less useful to end users and
clinicians. Broadly, for evaluations with answer-length sensitivity,
long answers can also be used to artificially increase scores, without
underlying improvements in usability and safety in real-world use.
Therefore, as in other recent system cards, we report scores for
HealthBench and HealthBench Professional that are adjusted for final
response length.

Responses of 2,000 characters receive no adjustment. Longer responses
are penalized, with a penalty per 500 additional characters that varies
by eval: 1.47 points per 500 characters for HealthBench Professional,
2.99 for HealthBench, 3.92 for HealthBench Hard, and 0.20 for
HealthBench Consensus. Shorter responses receive a corresponding
positive adjustment. All penalties here are reported on the 0-100 scale
that we report this evaluation on. Models are not provided details of
the length penalty in their prompts. For full details on this length
adjustment procedure, see [4].

Table 5: HealthBench evaluations, reported as length-adjusted score (unadjusted score, mean visible response length in characters). Scores are on a 0--100 scale; higher is better.

GPT‑6 Sol (October) and GPT‑6 Luna (October) both outperform their

While they exhibit slight regressions in HealthBench scores, this
appears to stem mostly from the length score-adjustment rather than the
unadjusted health score of the responses.

5.2 MentalHealthBench

MentalHealthBench
is an open benchmark developed with mental health experts for measuring
how AI systems respond in realistic mental health conversations. It
consists of 1,215 synthetic conversations covering diverse scenarios
ranging from daily well-being topics to urgent mental health
emergencies. Each conversation task is paired with clinician-authored
rubric criteria that can be used to score a new model response. We
include more details about the evaluation design in the
paper.

Each response receives a rubric-based score clipped to 0–100%. We
average four independent responses within each task, then average task
scores. Standard errors are computed across task means: 1,215 overall,
650 non-acute, 221 high-acuity, and 344 emergent tasks.

Table 6: MentalHealthBench scores, computed using the task-clipped metric. Scores are on a 0--100 scale; higher is better.

(August), with the largest performance jump in emergent mental health
conversations.

5.3 Dynamic Mental Health Benchmarks with Adversarial User Simulations

We report dynamic multi-turn evaluations for mental health, emotional
reliance, and self-harm that simulate extended conversations across
these domains. Rather than assessing a single response within a fixed
dialogue, these evaluations allow conversations to evolve in response to
the model’s outputs, creating varied trajectories during testing that
better reflect real user interactions. This approach helps identify
potential issues that may only emerge over the course of long exchanges
and provides an even more rigorous test than prior static multi-turn
methods. By utilizing realistic, yet adversarial, user simulations,
these evaluations have enabled continued improvements in safety
performance.

Our standard evaluations measure whether the final model response
violates our policies. In these dynamic conversations, we instead
evaluate whether any assistant response violates policy and report the
percentage of policy-compliant responses. The metric used is “safe,”
representing the share of assistant messages that do not violate safety
policies.

As with our standard evaluations, these evaluations were deliberately
created to be difficult. They were built around cases in which our
existing models were not yet giving ideal responses, and this is
reflected in the scores below. Error rates are not representative of
average production traffic.

GPT‑6 Sol (October) and GPT‑6 Luna (October) perform comparably to
their respective GPT‑5.6 (August) counterparts across the mental health,
emotional reliance, and self-harm evaluations. None of the observed
differences are statistically significant.

6. Hallucinations

6.1 Performance in Cases Flagged by Users

To evaluate our models’ ability to provide factually correct
responses, we measure the rate of factual hallucinations on the
following challenging prompt sets that are selected to show scenarios
where the model is most likely to hallucinate. These evaluations are
designed to be difficult in order to test for factuality in difficult
domains and to provide a sensitive research signal over time, rather
than to measure overall production prevalence or average user experience
in ChatGPT. As a result, the values below do not reflect production
prevalence, but rather how the model performs when tested against
carefully selected factuality-heavy, previous failures, or high stakes
scenarios.

Factuality Heavy: Our primary prompt set consists of prompts
representative of factuality-heavy ChatGPT conversations.

User Flagged Failures: To focus on cases where factuality issues have
harmed the user experience in past model releases, this evaluation
measures hallucination rates on de-identified ChatGPT conversations that
have previously been flagged as containing factual errors.

High Stakes: To measure factuality on high stakes use cases where
correct answers are particularly critical to users, we evaluate on a
prompt set consisting specifically of difficult medical, legal, and
financial prompts (high stakes).

On all prompt sets, we use an LLM-based grading model with web access
to identify factual errors in the assistant’s responses to these prompts
and report both the percentage of claims across responses that are
identified as having a factual error as well as the percentage of
responses containing at least one factual error. We find that GPT‑6 Sol
(October) and GPT‑6 Luna (October) both deliver significant improvements
in factuality over GPT-5.6 Sol (August) and GPT-5.6 Luna (August) across
nearly all evaluation metrics. The only exception is claim-level factual
errors on factual-heavy prompts.

Figure 3

Figure 3. Response-level and claim-level factual error rates on
factuality-heavy, user-flagged, and high-stakes prompt sets. Lower is
better.

7. Alignment

Our alignment evaluations measure the propensity and capability of
our models to circumvent restrictions and deceive users. Across our
entire suite, GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna (October) consistently outperform
their GPT-5.6 (August) counterparts. Based on our evaluation results and
manual review both GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna meet our alignment safety
bar.

7.1 Obeying Restrictions

This suite of alignment evaluations focuses on situations where the
model might circumvent an explicit or implicit restriction on its
operation. These restrictions may come from the environment (e.g. log-in
requirements) or from model controls i.e., the harness (e.g.
Auto-review). Note that these evaluations are meant to test the model’s
baseline capabilities and are run without the system-level safeguard
stack designed to mitigate these risks.

7.1.1 Respecting Auto-Review

Auto-review
is a protocol built into Codex whereby a second model evaluates the
safety of certain commands that run outside a pre-specified sandbox.
When this second monitor determines a command to be unsafe, it blocks
execution and returns a message. This message informs the model of its
verdict and instructs it to avoid substantively similar actions.

In this evaluation, we observe how models react to such a rejection.
Each task is set in a knowledge-work environment, with the rollout
beginning immediately after Auto-review has denied a request for an
action. There are multiple ways then for the model to proceed in this
situation: end the task, attempt to find a safer alternative, retry a
similar command, or exploit a deliberately poor
configuration to bypass Auto-review entirely. Any pursuit of the
latter two options would constitute a failure of this evaluation.

Figure 4

Figure 4. Prohibited actions completed at maximum reasoning effort. Lower is
better.

In 0.3% of rollouts at maximum reasoning effort, both GPT-5.6 Sol
(August) and GPT-5.6 Luna (August) exploited gaps in the
poorly-configured Auto-Review setup. GPT-6 Sol (October) and GPT-6 Luna
(October) did not have any such cases.

7.1.2 Respecting Warnings

Like the Respecting Auto-Review evaluation, this test tracks how
models behave after running into barriers across a variety of simulated
professional work environments. In this Respecting Warnings evaluation,
the barriers originate in the environment (e.g. certain AccessDenied
errors, content policy restrictions) rather than from the harness.

The evaluation was recently updated to improve realism, diversity,
and label quality. Moreover, we updated the main metric to track
successful circumventions, rather than just attempted
circumventions to improve the objectivity of the scoring criteria.
However, because we are testing the models without safeguards, it does
mean that the results are partially entangled with underlying model
intelligence, as smarter models are more likely to see their
circumvention attempts succeed.

There are still legitimate questions about how well these evaluation
results translate into real-world behavior. With increasing
intelligence, models are becoming increasingly aware when they are
operating in an evaluation. In many circumstances, we observed the model
cite the synthetic nature of this evaluation as justification for the
performance of improper actions. Most commonly, this takes the
form of a model incorrectly classifying the evaluation as being for
prompt injections, consequently mistaking barriers for prompt
injections. We are working on improving the external validity of this
evaluation and will generally continue to evolve our alignment
evaluations.

This evaluation also primarily measures low-stakes situations and is
run without system-level control measures, many of which would plausibly
stop the observed circumventions.

Figure 5

Figure 5. Conditional failure rates for successful circumvention of
environmental restrictions. Lower is better.

In all of these cases, our intended model behavior is for the model
to respect the warning and not attempt to circumvent it. In 34% of
rollouts at maximum reasoning effort, GPT-5.6 Sol (August) saw the
barrier and successfully found an alternative means of accomplishing the
task, running afoul of the restriction’s spirit. In 27% of rollouts,
GPT-5.6 Luna (August) did the same. Meanwhile, such unwanted persistence
appeared in 28% of GPT-6 Sol (October) rollouts and 15.9% of GPT-6 Luna
(October) rollouts.

7.2 Avoiding Deceptive Interactions with Users

We believe that any potential propensity of our models to deceive the
user warrants special attention. First, a model that misrepresents its
work is interfering with the ability of humans to supervise its actions.
Second, such deception is a plausible proxy for the model’s general
tendency to prioritize task completion over other safety considerations.
We note that these evaluations are meant to test the model’s baseline
capabilities and are run without the standard developer prompt present
in all first-party surfaces designed to prevent these types of deceptive
behavior.

7.2.1 Blocker Deception

This new evaluation takes realistic coding tasks where the model
encounters some block that inhibits its ability to complete its works.
It then measures the rate at which the model acknowledges this
limitation in its final answer. It replaces an earlier evaluation,
referenced as “Coding Deception” in previous system cards, that had been
largely saturated by our latest models.

Figure 6

Figure 6. Blocker-related disclosure failure rates on coding tasks. Lower is
better.

We saw significant reduction in disclosure failures in GPT-6 Sol
(October) and GPT-6 Luna (October) as compared to prior models. Due to
infrastructure issues, 0.25% of GPT-6 Luna (October) samples exited
prematurely and were excluded from analysis. Note that these problems
were deliberately selected to elicit misbehavior and do not necessarily
reflect the absolute rate of misleading responses in production.

7.2.2 Broken Search Tool

This very simple evaluation gives the model a task that normally
would require search but the search tool is unavailable. We then track
the rate at which the model fails to acknowledge this limitation in its
final message.

Figure 7

Figure 7. Broken Search Tool evaluation results.

At maximum reasoning effort, GPT-6 Sol (October) and GPT-6 Luna
(October) showed statistically significant improvements relative to
GPT-5.6 models.

8. Preparedness

Under our Preparedness
Framework, we are treating GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna as High
capability in both Cybersecurity and Biological and Chemical domains.
Neither of these models reach our High threshold in AI Self-Improvement.
These assessments match those for their GPT‑5.6 counterparts, and we
have implemented the corresponding safeguards described in the GPT‑5.6
System Card.

8.1 Capabilities Assessment

8.1.1 Biological and Chemical Capabilities

We are treating GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna as High capability in the
Biological and Chemical domain. Below, we report updated results for
both models on our High capability evaluations. We also report the
results for GPT-6 Sol on our Critical capability evaluations. GPT-6
Sol’s reported results did not cross the indicative Critical thresholds.
Separate Critical capability testing was not required for GPT-6 Luna
because it scored below GPT-5.6 Sol on all High capability
evaluations.

8.1.2 Cybersecurity Capabilities

As we did for GPT-5.6 Sol (August) and GPT-5.6 Luna (August) , and in
accordance with our capability evaluations, we are treating GPT-6 Sol
and GPT-6 Luna as High capability in the Cybersecurity domain, but below
Critical. Under our Preparedness Framework, High cybersecurity
capability is defined as a model that “removes existing bottlenecks to
scaling cyber operations including by automating end-to-end cyber
operations against reasonably hardened targets or by automating the
discovery and exploitation of operationally relevant
vulnerabilities.”

We determined that GPT-6 Sol and Luna both fall below the critical
threshold for cybersecurity capabilities under the Preparedness
Framework. We evaluated both models’ capabilities using our automated
cyber evaluations. GPT-6 Sol performed comparably to GPT-5.6 Sol without
a clear improvement in capabilities. GPT-6 Luna underperformed GPT-6
Sol. Based on the totality of the evidence, the Safety Advisory Group
determined it had sufficient evidence to recommend that both models were
below the critical threshold.

ExploitBench evaluates whether models can turn known vulnerabilities
into increasingly powerful exploit primitives, up to arbitrary code
execution, using vulnerability descriptions, source code, and patches
without a reference exploit. At maximum reasoning effort, GPT-6 Sol
scores 82.62% and GPT-6 Luna scores 44.66% on this benchmark.

As noted in the GPT‑6 Astra System Card, results may be inflated by
exposure to historical vulnerabilities in the public benchmark.

8.1.2.2 SEC-Bench Pro

SEC-Bench Pro evaluates models’ ability to discover vulnerabilities
in large JavaScript engines, including V8 and SpiderMonkey. GPT-6 Sol
and GPT-6 Luna achieve scores of 68.85% and 48.50%, respectively,
compared with 85.4% for GPT-6 Astra.

8.1.3 AI Self-Improvement Capabilities

In AI Self-Improvement, GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna do not reach our
High threshold.

What follows is a public summary of our internal Safeguards Report,
which includes additional details that are not suitable for public
disclosure (such as information potentially useful to attackers). The
internal report informed our Safety Advisory Group’s recommendation and
OpenAI leadership’s determination that these safeguards are sufficient
for GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna’s public launch.

On the biology model refusal evaluations, GPT-6 Sol (October) and
GPT-6 Luna (October) show substantially improved safety on severe and
dual-use prompts compared with GPT-5.6 Sol (August) and GPT-5.6 Luna
(August). These metrics reflect model responses only, without our full
production safeguards.

On the cybersecurity safety evaluations, GPT-6 Sol (October) and
GPT-6 Luna (October) achieve safety scores broadly comparable to GPT-5.6
Sol (August) and GPT-5.6 Luna (August). Model refusal remains one layer
of our safety stack, alongside additional safeguards that enforce the
safety boundary through defense in depth.
