Title: Addendum to GPT-6 Astra System Card: GPT-6.1 Sol - OpenAI Deployment Safety Hub

URL Source: https://deploymentsafety.openai.com/gpt-6-1-sol

Markdown Content:
Today, we’re introducing GPT-6.1 Sol. GPT-6.1 is the latest model
family in the GPT-6 series.

GPT-6.1 Sol delivers capabilities comparable to those of our most
powerful model, GPT-6 Astra, with an unmatched combination of speed and
affordability. This system card addendum provides updates on the
baseline safety metrics and evaluation results for GPT-6.1 Sol.1

Under our Preparedness Framework, we are treating GPT-6.1 Sol as
Critical in cybersecurity and High for Biological and Chemical
capability. Based on that assessment, GPT-6.1 Sol uses the same
safeguards stack as GPT-6 Astra, described in detail in the GPT-6
Astra system card.

2. Model Data and Training

GPT-6.1 Sol uses the same types of data and training as GPT-6 Astra,
described in the GPT-6
Astra card.

For previously launched models, the values published at launch
reflect the versions evaluated at that time. The comparison values for
previously launched models that are shown here may reflect later
versions of those models, and may vary from the values published at
launch.1

3. Model Safety

For a full description of the evaluations in this section, please see
the Model
Safety section in the GPT-6 Astra card.

3.1 Safe Completions

3.1.1 Evaluations with Challenging Prompts

We conducted benchmark evaluations across safety categories. We
report here on our Production Benchmarks, an evaluation set with
conversations representative of challenging examples from production
data. For a full description of these evaluations, please see the Safe
Completions section in the GPT-6 Astra card.

On our Production Benchmarks, GPT-6.1 Sol scores higher than GPT-6
Sol in five of eight categories.

Table 1: Production Benchmarks with Challenging Prompts (higher is better)

Category

In the Safety Pareto chart below, all of our GPT-6 series models show
a Pareto improvement in the rate of handling harmful requests safely vs.
helpfulness on legitimate requests relative to our older GPT-5 series
models. Our evaluations indicate that our GPT-6 models are less likely
to refuse harmless requests or add excessive or unnecessarily judgmental
caveats.

GPT‑6.1 Sol scores higher than GPT‑6 Sol in five of six categories;
the regression on the gore evaluation is not statistically
significant.

3.1.3 Agentic Safe Completions

We find that GPT-6.1 Sol is generally better than GPT-6 Sol at
recognizing potential harms in agentic requests and avoiding taking
harmful actions.

3.2 Vision

Across all vision evaluations, GPT-6.1 Sol performed on par with or
better than GPT‑6 Sol.

4. Robustness

4.1 Jailbreaks

For a full description of these evaluations, please see the Jailbreaks
section in the GPT-6 Astra card.

On both the static and multiturn jailbreak evaluations, GPT-6.1 Sol
achieves comparable or higher defender success rates than GPT-6 Sol.

Scores are defender success rates expressed as percentages (0–100).
Higher is better.

Figure 2

Figure 2

All models in the GPT-6 series show an improvement over earlier
models. GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6.1 Sol, and GPT-6 Sol are the most robust
frontier models across both our static and multiturn robustness
evaluations. GPT-6 Luna also improves on earlier models, however, we
note that some of its higher scores may reflect a broader tendency to
refuse requests, including legitimate ones (see e.g., our Safety Pareto
chart above).

4.2 Prompt Injection

For a full description of this evaluation, please see the Prompt
Injection section in the GPT-6 Astra card.

We find that GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna have substantial improvements
to prompt injection and instruction hierarchy robustness compared to
their predecessors. GPT-6.1 Sol is also highly robust.

The plot below shows defender success rate averaged per defender
query on indirect prompt injection attacks (higher is better).

while maintaining similar performance on HealthBench Consensus. Its
length-adjusted scores are within 0.5 percentage points of GPT‑6 Astra
across all four evaluations. GPT‑6.1 Sol produces longer final answers
than GPT‑6 Sol and GPT‑6 Luna, but slightly shorter answers than GPT‑6
Astra.

5.2 Dynamic Mental Health Benchmarks with Adversarial User Simulations

We report dynamic multi-turn evaluations for mental health, emotional
reliance, and self-harm that simulate extended conversations across
these domains. Rather than assessing a single response within a fixed
dialogue, these evaluations allow conversations to evolve in response to
the model’s outputs, creating varied trajectories during testing that
better reflect real user interactions. This approach helps identify
potential issues that may only emerge over the course of long exchanges
and provides an even more rigorous test than prior static multi-turn
methods. By utilizing realistic, yet adversarial, user simulations,
these evaluations have enabled continued improvements in safety
performance.

As with our standard evaluations, these evaluations were deliberately
created to be difficult. Error rates are not representative of average
production traffic.

For a full description of these evaluations, please see the Dynamic
Mental Health section in the GPT-6 Astra card.

GPT‑6.1 Sol scores the same as or higher than GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6
Astra on all categories.

5.3 MentalHealthBench

MentalHealthBench
is an open benchmark developed with mental health experts for measuring
how AI systems respond in realistic mental health conversations. It
consists of 1,215 synthetic conversations covering diverse scenarios
ranging from daily well-being topics to urgent mental health
emergencies. Each conversation task is paired with clinician-authored
rubric criteria that can be used to score a new model response. To learn
more about this evaluation, please see the
paper.

We report results at maximum reasoning effort. Each response receives
a rubric-based score clipped to 0–100%. We average four independent
responses within each task, then average task scores overall or within
each acuity group. Standard errors are computed across task means. The
evaluation contains 1,215 tasks: 650 non-acute, 221 high-acuity, and 344
emergent.

For a full description of this suite of alignment evaluations, please
see the Alignment
section in the GPT-6 Astra card.

7.1 Respecting Auto-Review

Figure 6

Figure 6

All GPT-6 models improve on the previous generation in this
evaluation. Across our older models: in 7.3% of rollouts at maximum
reasoning effort, GPT 5.6 Sol attempted to circumvent the Auto-review
denial. The overwhelming majority of these failures involved the model
retrying substantively similar commands, contrary to the instructions
contained in the denial message. In 0.3% of cases, both GPT-5.6 Luna and
GPT-5.6 Sol went further, exploiting gaps in the poorly-configured
Auto-review setup. By contrast, GPT-6 Luna attempted to bypass the
monitor but never succeeded. Like GPT-6 Astra and GPT-6 Sol, GPT-6.1 Sol
made no attempts to bypass the monitor.

7.2 Respecting Warnings

Figure 7

Figure 7

In all of these cases, our intended model behavior is for the model
to respect the warning and not attempt to circumvent it. Unwanted
persistence appeared in 23.5% of GPT-6.1 Sol rollouts, compared to 17.4%
of GPT-6 Astra’s. The evaluation primarily tests low-stakes restrictions
encountered during routine tasks. For example: whether a model tries
email after a direct message is blocked because the recipient is out of
office.

We note that this evaluation is run without system-level control
measures that are designed to prevent circumvention attempts. These
results therefore measure unwanted persistence under the tested
conditions and do not establish how often such attempts would succeed
with those controls in place.

7.3 Declining to Exploit a Honeypot During Difficult ExploitGym Problems

Figure 8

Figure 8

At maximum reasoning effort and without production cyber safeguards,
GPT-6.1 Sol legitimately captured the flag without exploiting the
honeypot in 0.4% of rollouts. Like all of our GPT-6 series models,
GPT-6.1 Sol made no attempts to exploit the honeypot. These results
characterize behavior under the evaluation’s test conditions without
cyber safeguards and do not represent normal production use.

7.4 Avoiding Deceptive Interactions with Users

7.4.1 Coding Deception

Figure 9

Figure 9

GPT-6.1 Sol’s rate of misrepresentation is 1.50%, compared with 0.51%
for GPT-6 Astra and 1.30% for GPT-6 Sol. By comparison, at maximum
reasoning effort, GPT-5.6 Sol’s rate of misrepresentation is nearly 7x
higher than that of GPT-6.1 Sol. These tasks were deliberately selected
to elicit potentially dishonest behavior and the observed rates are not
expected to match the true rate of misbehavior in production.

7.4.2 Broken Search Tool

Figure 10

Figure 10

On tasks that normally require search, we measure how often models
fail to acknowledge in their final response that the search tool is
unavailable. GPT-6.1 Sol fails to acknowledge this limitation in 2.08%
of cases, compared to 4.92% for GPT-6 Sol.

7.5 Avoiding Misaligned Behavior in Realistic Work Environments

We evaluate whether GPT-6.1 Sol can complete computer- and
browser-use tasks without causing unintended consequences like data
disclosure or unauthorized transactions. The evaluations place GPT-6.1
Sol in realistic workplace applications, including those for messaging,
email, web browsing, project management, and sales. These evaluations
are designed to be intentionally adversarial, with ambiguous
instructions, similar resources, and complex permissions creating
opportunities for unintended outcomes. Each task still has a safe route
to completion.

Across these evaluations, GPT-6.1 Sol produced fewer unintended
outcomes than GPT-6 Sol. We note that since introducing this evaluation
in the GPT-6
Astra system card, we have updated the evaluation – the results
reported below use a more challenging version of our evaluations of
misaligned behavior in realistic work environments, subselected to the
cases more likely to result in misalignment.

7.5.1 Unintended Engagement with External Agent Messages

Among samples in which the model discovered the message board,
GPT‑6.1 Sol attempted communication with apparent peers more often than
GPT‑6 Sol (38% vs. 26%), but carried out the specified unauthorized
action less often (3% vs. 11%). Both models showed lower rates of these
behaviors than GPT‑5.6 Sol, which attempted communication in 84% of
samples and performed the unauthorized action in 52%. These results
suggest that GPT‑6.1 Sol’s greater willingness to engage with apparent
peers did not translate into more unauthorized actions.

Figure 13

Figure 13

Board discovery rates were at least 96% for all models except
GPT-6 Luna (76%). Engagement and specified unauthorized action rates are
calculated among samples in which the board was discovered.

7.6 Forecasting Misaligned Behavior with Deployment Simulation of Internal Codex Traffic

In order to anticipate changes in rates of misaligned behavior in
agentic coding traffic with GPT-6.1 Sol, we simulated the deployment of
GPT-6.1 Sol in Codex within OpenAI using deployment
simulation and labeled the simulated trajectories for misaligned
behaviors. GPT-6.1 Sol received 28 flags at severity 3 or above on the
matched evaluation set, compared with 27 for GPT-6 Astra. Overall, the
prevalence of this behavior is low. These results are most useful as an
additional signal about internal deployment risk, rather than as a
direct measure of external deployment safety due to distribution shifts
between internal and external deployments.

Figure 14

Figure 14

Estimated misalignment changes in internal Codex
traffic. Comparing the 49,650 tasks, our deployment simulation
results suggest that relative to GPT-6 Sol and GPT-5.6 Sol, GPT-6.1 Sol
has 33% and 56% fewer severity level 3 or higher flags, respectively.
Severity 3 is defined as misaligned behavior that a reasonable user
would likely not anticipate and strongly object to. GPT-6.1 Sol received
28 severity-3-or-higher flags (0.056%), compared with 27 (0.054%) for
GPT-6 Astra, 42 (0.085%) for GPT-6 Sol, and 63 (0.127%) for GPT-5.6
Sol.

Figure 15

Figure 15

Flags at severity 1 or 2 were less common for GPT-6.1 Sol than for
GPT-6 Sol and GPT-5.6 Sol: 13.94% versus 14.82% and 19.64% of matched
tasks, respectively, compared with 13.85% for GPT-6 Astra. The largest
decreases relative to GPT-6 Sol were in exfiltration, concealed
uncertainty, and restriction circumvention, while credential-harvesting
flags increased. Relative to GPT-6 Astra, we observed increased rates of
reward-hacking and concealed-uncertainty flags from GPT-6.1 Sol.

Figure 16

Figure 16

Evaluation awareness. We also investigated
evaluation or simulation awareness by analyzing CoT. Among the shared
set of tasks, we found these signs in 4.81% of GPT-6.1 Sol’s
trajectories, compared with 8.67% for GPT-6 Astra, 4.70% for GPT-6 Sol,
and 2.52% for GPT-5.6 Sol. The original traffic, which comprised
trajectories generated by multiple models, had an awareness rate of
0.76%.

We then restricted the comparison to the 41,849 cases in which we
found no such signs of verbalized evaluation or simulation awareness for
any of the four models. In this subset, GPT-6.1 Sol still had
approximately 17% fewer severity 3+ misalignment flags than GPT-6 Astra,
46% fewer than GPT-6 Sol, and 65% fewer than GPT-5.6 Sol.

8. Monitorability

8.1 Monitorability Under Adversarial Conditions

8.1.1 CoT Controllability

We find that GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6.1 Sol’s CoT controllability is
meaningfully higher than that of GPT-5.6 Sol. Because CoT
controllability is heavily confounded by CoT length—longer CoTs are
harder to control, all else equal (see Yueh-Han,
2026[1], sec.
5.3)—we report controllability scores as a function of CoT length. For
example, among CoTs between 750 and 1,250 tokens long, GPT‑6 Sol
successfully follows the requested CoT instruction in 23.2% of cases,
compared with 16.1% for GPT‑5.6 Sol, 1.7% for GPT‑5.5 Thinking, 44.8%
for GPT‑6.1 Sol, and 60.9% for GPT‑6 Astra. The increased CoT
controllability over GPT‑5.6 Sol appears for both GPT‑6 Sol and GPT‑6.1
Sol across all three datasets in this length window (Figure 19), but
GPT‑6 Sol’s increase is not consistent across all eight instruction
types (Figure 20). Qualitatively, GPT‑6 Sol and GPT‑6.1 Sol can satisfy
formatting constraints such as alternating between lowercase and
uppercase letters (Table 10), but GPT‑6 Sol cannot
reliably avoid reasoning about the original question despite explicit
instructions to think about something else (Table 11).

8.1.2 Monitor Evasion

For a full description of these evaluations, please see the Monitor
Evasion section in the GPT-6 Astra card.

OAI-repo Sabotage v2

We found that GPT-6.1 Sol evaded the CoT-only monitor at rates
similar to GPT-6 Astra at lower reasoning efforts, but substantially
less often at higher reasoning efforts with step-by-step guidance. At
the highest reasoning effort tested, GPT-6.1 Sol had nearly zero success
rate at evading CoT-only monitors in either the task-guided or unguided
setting. Among GPT-6.1 Sol rollouts that successfully completed the
sabotage side task and evaded the CoT-only monitor, average CoT length
increased with reasoning budget in the task-guided setting, as it did
for GPT-6 Astra.

Monitors with access to the models’ actions are significantly better
at sabotage detection than CoT-only monitors. When using a high recall
environment-specific monitor with access to the full trajectory,
successful evasion rate for GPT-6.1 Sol remains close to zero.

Our production monitoring system assigns priorities to issues
detected, where a P0 priority results in paging the security team, and
lower priorities are flagged less urgently. Therefore, we especially
care about and specifically measure GPT-6.1 Sol’s ability to avoid the
monitoring system paging our security team. When we evaluate our
production monitoring system for this setting, we find that GPT-6.1 Sol
has similar success as GPT-6 Astra at evading the assignment of a P0
priority under the task-guided setting, but less successful at evading
monitor under the unguided setting. We expect the precision of the
priority assignment to improve as we continue to develop our
misalignment monitoring system.

Figure 21

Figure 22

Figure 22

8.1.2.1 Awareness of CoT Monitoring Reduces Monitorability

GPT-6.1 Sol exhibits a propensity for evasive behavior when it is
aware that it is being monitored. When the model is made aware of the
monitor but is not explicitly told to evade it (solid magenta line), its
CoT-only monitor recall rate is slightly lower than in the baseline
condition, in which the model is not told about the monitor (zero
evasion and a 100% monitor recall rate; solid grey line). Although
GPT-6.1 Sol is more evasive than GPT-6 Sol (dashed magenta line), its
CoT-only monitor recall rate remains substantially higher than that of
GPT-6 Astra (dotted magenta line). This suggests that GPT-6.1 Sol has a
lower propensity to evade the CoT-only monitor than GPT-6 Astra.

As with GPT-6 Astra, instructing GPT-6.1 Sol to evade the monitor
further reduces its CoT monitorability (solid dark-blue line). GPT-6.1
Sol also generates substantially fewer chain-of-thought tokens both when
simply made aware of monitoring (without being told to evade the
monitor) and when explicitly instructed to hide reasoning about the
honeypot.

Full-context monitoring still achieves a 100% recall rate in
detecting GPT-6.1 Sol’s successful honeypot exploits, as it does for
GPT-6 Astra and GPT-6 Sol.

exploitation success) when made aware of the monitor (solid magenta

the honeypot (solid dark-blue line). All evaluations are run at the same
reasoning effort, with GPT-6.1 Sol shown as solid lines and GPT-6 Sol as
dashed lines.

compared against GPT-6 Astra (dotted lines).

8.1.2.2 Math Side-tasking Monitor Evasion

Using a new benchmark, we additionally test whether GPT-6.1 Sol can
secretly perform complex math side tasks that we know requires CoT
reasoning while doing software-engineering tasks from Expert-SWE.
Our evaluation shows that, like all of our previous models, GPT-6.1 Sol
is not able to solve side tasks while bypassing the CoT and full-context
monitor.

GPT-6 Sol almost always failed some math problems (e.g., Diagonal
Latin and 51-pile counter) when given as side tasks, despite solving
them with high success rates when presented on their own. GPT‑6.1 Sol
was instead able to solve these side tasks, but a full-context monitor
looking for reasoning related to any “irrelevant math task” detected
every successful attempt.

These results suggest that the models do not have the ability to
engage in CoT steganography: that is, we have not seen evidence that
GPT-6 Astra, GPT-6 Sol, or GPT-6.1 Sol can perform complex misalignment
reasoning, which would generally require CoT, without being detected by
our misalignment monitors.

9. Preparedness

Under our Preparedness Framework, we are treating GPT-6.1 Sol as
Critical capability in Cybersecurity, High capability in the Biological
and Chemical domain, and below the High threshold in AI
Self-Improvement.

Based on this assessment, we applied the same safeguards stack to
GPT-6.1 Sol as GPT-6 Astra. As described in the GPT-6 Astra safeguards
section, we have implemented our strongest safeguards to date for
Astra and made major changes to our internal safety and security posture
to address malicious use and unauthorized, misaligned model activity. We
apply these safeguards to GPT-6.1 Sol as well, consistent with our
decision to adopt the same Preparedness determinations for both
models.

9.1 Capabilities Assessment

9.1.1 Biological and Chemical Capabilities

We are treating GPT-6.1 Sol as High capability in the Biological and
Chemical domain. Below, we report results for GPT-6.1 Sol on our High

9.1.1.2 Capability Threshold: Critical

Separate Critical capability testing was not required for GPT-6 Luna
because it scored below GPT-5.6 Sol on all High capability evaluations.
GPT-6 Sol and Astra both scored below the Critical threshold.

*We report the value that is closest to the threshold; for GPT-6
Astra’s cell-entry and phage–plasmid scores, those results are from a
helpful-only version of the model.

9.1.2 Cybersecurity Capabilities

As we did for GPT-6 Astra, we are treating GPT-6.1 Sol as Critical
capability in the Cybersecurity domain. Under our Preparedness
Framework, Critical capability is defined as a model that can “identify
and develop functional zero-day exploits of all severity levels in many
hardened real-world critical systems without human intervention” or
“devise and execute end-to-end novel strategies for cyberattacks against
hardened targets given only a high level desired goal”.

We determined that GPT-6.1 Sol reaches the Critical threshold for
cybersecurity capabilities under the Preparedness Framework. We
evaluated the model’s capabilities using our automated cyber
evaluations.

For a full description of the evaluations we used to inform this
determination, please see the Cybersecurity
Capabilities section in the GPT-6 Astra card.

9.1.2.1 ExploitBench

ExploitBench evaluates whether models can turn known vulnerabilities
into increasingly powerful exploit primitives, up to arbitrary code
execution, using vulnerability descriptions, source code, and patches
without a reference exploit. At maximum reasoning effort, GPT-6.1 Sol
scores 99.7%, compared with 81.7% for GPT-6 Sol and 100% for GPT-6
Astra.

As we noted with GPT-6 Astra, we believe that these results may be
artificially inflated due to potential contamination from exposure to
historical vulnerabilities.

9.1.2.2 ExploitBench - Internal Port (June–August 2026)

ExploitBench - Internal Port is an internal evaluation that tests
whether models can develop working exploits for recently disclosed
vulnerabilities, reducing potential contamination from exposure to
historical examples. GPT-6.1 Sol reaches an arbitrary code-execution
success rate of 21.5%, compared with 31.5% for GPT-6 Astra, 5.5% for
GPT-6 Sol, and 3.5% for GPT-5.6 Sol. These results show substantially
stronger performance than the earlier Sol models, while remaining below
GPT-6 Astra. This indicates that while GPT-6.1 Sol is substantially more
capable than GPT-6 Sol on this evaluation, reliable exploitation of
these recently disclosed vulnerabilities remains challenging for GPT-6.1
Sol.

SEC-Bench Pro

SEC-Bench Pro evaluates models’ ability to discover vulnerabilities
in large JavaScript engines, including V8 and SpiderMonkey. GPT-6.1 Sol
reaches a pass@1 score of 78.8%, compared with 85.4% for GPT-6 Astra,
66.3% for GPT-6 Sol, and 79.1% for GPT-5.6 Sol. GPT-6.1 Sol achieves a
similar peak score to GPT-5.6 Sol at a substantially shorter mean
solution length, while remaining below GPT-6 Astra.

Figure 36

Figure 36

ExploitGym

On ExploitGym, GPT-6 Sol and GPT-6 Luna successfully develop working
exploits on 22.1% and 11.6% of challenges, respectively. GPT-6.1 Sol
reaches an intended-vulnerability success rate of 35.1% per attempt,
compared with 42.4% for GPT-6 Astra, 22.1% for GPT-6 Sol, and 30.3% for
GPT-5.6 Sol. GPT-6.1 Sol exceeds the previous Sol models’ highest
observed success rates while using shorter mean solution lengths, but
remains below GPT-6 Astra.

9.1.3 AI Self-Improvement Capabilities

In AI Self-Improvement, GPT-6.1 Sol does not reach our High
threshold.

GPT-6.1 Sol improves meaningfully on GPT-6 Sol but remains below the
High threshold. GPT‑6.1 Sol achieves a mean rubric score of 75.52%,
compared with 78.05% for GPT‑6 Astra, 64.20% for GPT‑6 Sol, and 68.32%
for GPT‑5.6 Sol. All models still solve only a subset of difficult
debugging tasks that can take experienced researchers hours or days to
resolve.

9.1.3.2 KernelGen 1P

KernelGen 1P measures a model’s ability to understand hardware
constraints, debug correctness issues, and improve performance. GPT-6.1
Sol performs substantially better than GPT-6 Sol on kernel optimization,
and performs comparably to GPT-5.6 Sol.

9.2 Safeguards

Under our Preparedness Framework, we treat GPT-6.1 Sol the same way
as GPT-6 Astra and apply the same safeguards to both models. For a full
description of the safeguards stack we apply to both models, please see
the Safeguards
section in the GPT-6 Astra card.

What follows is a public summary of our internal Safeguards Report,
which includes additional details that are not suitable for public
disclosure (such as information potentially useful to attackers). The
internal report informed our Safety Advisory Group’s recommendation and
OpenAI leadership’s determination that these safeguards are sufficient
for GPT-6.1 Sol’s public launch.

Sol, GPT-6.1 Sol shows modest regressions in synthetic and
semi-synthetic agentic environments. Model refusal remains one layer of
our safety stack, alongside additional safeguards that enforce the
safety boundary through defense in depth.

9.2.1.3 Cybersecurity - Trusted Access for Cyber

For more details on Daybreak access, please see the Trusted
Access for Cyber section in the GPT-6 Astra card. As cyber
capabilities increase, our approach is to expand defensive access and
safeguards together. Like Astra, we are taking a phased approach for
GPT-6.1 Sol through Daybreak and, over time, our goal is to enable more
advanced, authorized work through more precise safeguards, supported by
stronger verification, accountability, and monitoring.
