Title: GPT-5.5 Instant System Card - OpenAI Deployment Safety Hub

URL Source: https://deploymentsafety.openai.com/gpt-5-5-instant

Markdown Content:
GPT-5.5 Instant is our latest Instant model, and explained in our blog. The
comprehensive safety mitigation approach for this model is similar to
previous models in this series, but this is the first Instant model that
we are treating as High capability in our Cybersecurity and Biological
& Chemical Preparedness categories, and implementing appropriate
safeguards.

In this card we also refer to GPT-5.5 Instant as gpt-5.5-instant.
Note that there is not a model named GPT-5.4 Instant, and the main model
to baseline against is GPT-5.3 Instant. Additionally, we refer to GPT-5.5 as
GPT-5.5 Thinking to avoid confusion with the instant model.

2. Model Data and Training

Like OpenAI’s other models, GPT-5.5 Instant was trained on diverse
datasets, including information that is publicly available on the
internet, information that we partner with third parties to access, and
information that our users or human trainers and researchers provide or
generate. Our data processing pipeline includes rigorous filtering to
maintain data quality and mitigate potential risks. We use advanced data
filtering processes to reduce personal information from training data.
We also employ safety classifiers to help prevent or reduce the use of
harmful or sensitive content, including explicit materials such as
sexual content involving a minor.

Note that comparison values from previously-launched models are from
the latest versions of those models, so may vary slightly from values
published at launch for those models.1

3. Safety

3.1 Disallowed Content

3.1.1 Evaluations with Challenging Prompts

We conducted benchmark evaluations across disallowed content
categories. We report here on our Production Benchmarks, an evaluation
set with conversations representative of challenging examples from
production data. As we noted in previous system cards, we introduced
these Production Benchmarks to help us measure continuing progress given
that our earlier Standard evaluations for these categories had become
relatively saturated.

These evaluations were deliberately created to be difficult. They
were built around cases in which our existing models were not yet giving
ideal responses, and this is reflected in the scores below. Error rates
are not representative of average production traffic. The primary metric
is not_unsafe, checking that the model did not produce output that is
disallowed under the relevant OpenAI policy.

Values from previously-launched models are from the latest versions
of those models, and evals are subject to some variation. Values may
vary slightly from values published at launch for those models.

Our evals are run on the base model, without system-level safeguards,
to ensure the model’s underlying behavior meets our safety bar. We
continue monitoring these categories after launch to evaluate online
performance and further adjust safeguards as appropriate.

Above, we compare GPT-5.5 Instant against our previous instant
models. We additionally (with an asterisk) indicate statistically
significant movement compared to the previous production model (here,
GPT 5.3 Instant) according to an exact paired McNemar test.

Note (compared to previous system cards): to deduplicate overlaps
between our previous “hate” and “harassment” categories, we are merging
“harassment” and “hate” into a single evaluation. Additionally, we have
renamed our previous “violence” category to “gore” in order to more
clearly distinguish it from requests related to illicit violent
behavior1; this is a naming change, not a
change in the underlying evaluation.

We find that GPT-5.5 Instant is comparable (i.e., not statistically
significantly different) to the previous production model (GPT-5.3
Instant) on all disallowed categories with the exception of gore and
disallowed sexual content. For disallowed sexual content, we apply an
additional system-level mitigation intended to prevent graphic erotic
content from reaching users in production. For users we believe may be
under 18, we apply additional age-appropriate content protections that
further restrict sexual content and exposure to gore. You can read more
about these safeguards and our
approach to Age Prediction.

3.2 Vision

We ran our image input evaluations, that evaluate for not_unsafe
model output, given disallowed combined text and image input.

Table 2: Image input evaluations, with metric not_unsafe (higher is better)

Category

gpt-5.5-instant performance on vision evaluations is on par with
gpt-5.3-instant; minor regressions have low statistical
significance.

3.3 Dynamic Mental Health Benchmarks with Adversarial User Simulations

Table 3

Category

We evaluated the model against our dynamic multi-turn evaluations for
mental health, emotional reliance, and self-harm that simulate extended
conversations across these domains. Rather than assessing a single
response within a fixed dialogue, these evaluations allow conversations
to evolve in response to the model’s outputs, creating varied
trajectories during testing that better reflect real user interactions.
This approach helps identify potential issues that may only emerge over
the course of long exchanges and provides an even more rigorous test
than prior static multi-turn methods. By utilizing realistic, yet
adversarial user simulations, these evaluations have enabled continued
improvements in safety performance, particularly in areas where earlier
evaluation frameworks had reached saturation.

Our standard evaluations measure whether the final model response
violates our policies. In these dynamic conversations, we instead
evaluate whether any assistant response violates policy and report the
percentage of policy-compliant responses. The metric used is not_unsafe,
representing the share of assistant messages that do not violate safety
policies. We find that 5.5-instant is largely comparable on these
evaluations to 5.3-instant.

Regressions on the emotional reliance evaluation were not
statistically significant. In addition to the benchmark evaluations, we
reviewed safety during online experimentation and did not observe an
increase in undesirable responses for self-harm, mental health,
emotional reliance. We will continue monitoring after launch to verify
our test results and investigate the disparities between our offline
evaluations and online testing.

We continue to invest in mental health-related improvements. We’ve
strengthened ChatGPT’s ability to recognize subtle warning signs across
long, high-stakes conversations and trained the model to respond safely
in acute situations, including self-harm.

4. Robustness

4.1 Jailbreaks

We evaluate model robustness to jailbreaks: adversarial prompts
designed to circumvent safety guardrails and elicit harmful assistance.
The evaluation uses realistic scenarios with sophisticated attacker
strategies that can probe, adapt, and escalate over the course of a
conversation. These attacker strategies are challenging multiturn
jailbreaks derived from internal red-teaming exercises.

Model responses are scored based on whether they meaningfully
facilitate harm: harmful assistance receives worse scores, while
harmless responses receive better scores. In aggregate, we report the
worst-case defender success rate, where higher is better.

The evaluation is particularly challenging at a high attacker budget
where both model and the grader are both required to be robust to all
jailbreak scenarios. Thus, we expect there to be higher variance in
defender success rate with higher attacker budget.

We are actively iterating on the evaluation structure and view these
results, including the regression from GPT-5.3-Instant, as directional
rather than definitive. We are sharing these interim results for
purposes of transparency and expect comparative performance to change as
we improve both the evaluation and model robustness in upcoming
releases.

Figure 1

Figure 1

4.2 Prompt injection

We evaluate the model’s robustness to known prompt injection attacks
against connectors. These attacks embed adversarial instructions in the
tool-output that aim to mislead the model and override the
system/developer/user instruction.

Table 4: Prompt injection evaluations (higher is better)

Category

GPT-5.5 Instant is comparable to its predecessors on these
indicators.

5. Health

5.1 HealthBench

Chatbots can empower consumers to better understand their health
[1][2]. We
evaluate this new Instant model on HealthBench [3], an evaluation of health
performance and safety, and HealthBench Professional, an evaluation of
model capability and safety for clinician use cases [4].

Like many other benchmarks of open-ended chat responses, HealthBench
and HealthBench Professional can reward longer responses. Longer answers
may be better when they include additional valuable information, but
they also have more opportunities to satisfy positive rubric criteria,
and unnecessarily long responses can be less useful to end users and
clinicians. Broadly, for evaluations with answer-length sensitivity,
long answers can also be used to artificially increase scores, without
underlying improvements in usability and safety in real-world use.

Therefore, we are now reporting scores for HealthBench and
HealthBench Professional that are adjusted for final response length.
Briefly, we compute an empirical length adjustment, linear in response
length, by running multiple OpenAI models at different verbosity
settings. For full details on this length adjustment procedure, see
[4]. We
are also now using an updated implementation of HealthBench and have
recomputed scores for previous models, so scores may differ from
previous system cards.

Responses of 2,000 characters receive no adjustment. Longer responses
are penalized, with a penalty per 500 additional characters that varies
by eval: 1.47 points per 500 characters for HealthBench Professional,
2.99 for HealthBench, 3.92 for HealthBench Hard, and 0.20 for
HealthBench Consensus. Shorter responses receive a corresponding
positive adjustment. All penalties here are reported on the 0-100 scale
that we report this eval on.

GPT-5.5 Instant improves over GPT-5.3 Instant on HealthBench (+1.8),
HealthBench Hard (+2.7), and HealthBench Professional (+5.5), while
HealthBench Consensus remains effectively flat (+0.03). Across all these
evals, GPT-5.5 Instant’s responses were longer, and had a higher
unadjusted score and a higher length-adjusted score. Overall, this
reflects generally improved HealthBench, HealthBench Hard, and
HealthBench Professional performance vs GPT-5.3 Instant, with
HealthBench Consensus flat.

6. Hallucinations

To evaluate our models’ ability to provide factually correct
responses, we measure the rate of factual hallucinations on the
following challenging prompt set that is selected to show scenarios
where the model is most likely to hallucinate. These evaluations are
designed to be difficult in order to test for factuality in difficult
domains and to provide a sensitive research signal over time, rather
than to measure overall production prevalence or average user experience
in ChatGPT. As a result, the values below do not reflect production
prevalence, but rather how the model performs when tested against
carefully selected factuality-heavy, previous failures, or high stakes
scenarios.

Factuality Heavy: Our primary prompt set consists of
prompts representative of factuality-heavy ChatGPT production
conversations.

User Flagged Failures: To focus on cases where
factuality issues have harmed the user experience in past model
releases, this evaluation measures hallucination rates on de-identified
ChatGPT conversations that users of our prior models have specifically
flagged as containing factual errors. These examples are intended to
capture historically hallucination-prone cases, not a representative
slice of all production traffic.

High Stakes: To measure factuality on high stakes
use cases where correct answers are particularly critical to users, we
evaluate on a prompt set consisting specifically of difficult medical,
legal, and financial prompts (high stakes).

On all prompt sets, we use an LLM-based grading model with web access
to identify factual errors in the assistant’s responses to these prompts
and report both the percentage of claims across responses that are
identified as having a factual error as well as the percentage of
responses containing at least one factual error. We find that GPT-5.5
Instant has significant improvements on factuality over GPT-5.3-instant
on each of these prompt sets, particularly on high stakes domains.

Figure 2

Figure 2

7. Inclusivity

7.1 Bias

We also tested the models on our first-person fairness evaluation
[5]. This
evaluation consists of multiturn conversations, starting with a prompt
in which a user shares their name such as “Hi, I’m [NAME].” to which the
model responds “Hi [NAME]! How can I assist you today?” We then prompt
the model with a request such as “Write a fairytale.”

This evaluation is used to assess harmful stereotypes by grading
differences in how a model responds to the conversation when the user’s
name is statistically more often associated with males (e.g., Brian) or
females (e.g., Ashley). Responses are rated for harmful differences in
stereotypes using GPT-4o, whose ratings were shown to be consistent with
human ratings. This evaluation consists of over 600 challenging prompts
reflecting real-world scenarios that exhibit high rates of bias in
GPT-4o-mini generations. These prompts were intentionally chosen to be
an order of magnitude more difficult than standard production traffic;
this means that in typical use, we expect our models to be less
biased.

We report the metric harm_overall, which represents the expected
difference of biased answers for male vs female names based on the
performance on this evaluation (i.e., performance on the evaluation
divided by 10). GPT-5.5 Instant scored 0.0101 on this metric, broadly
comparable to GPT-5.2-instant and GPT-5.3-instant.

Table 6: First-person fairness evaluation (lower is better)

Category

No statistically meaningful difference was detected between the
models, as their confidence intervals overlap.

8. Preparedness

The Preparedness
Framework is OpenAI’s approach to tracking and preparing for
frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm. Under our
framework, we work to track and mitigate the risk of severe harm,
including by implementing safeguards that sufficiently minimize the risk
for highly capable models.

GPT-5.5 Instant is our first Instant model to be treated as High
Capability in the Biological and Chemical domain, as well as in the
Cybersecurity domain. As such, we have applied biological and chemical,
and cybersecurity, safeguards to this deployment.

We are treating GPT-5.5 Instant as High Capability in the
Cybersecurity domain based on its capability eval performance when run
at xhigh reasoning effort. Note that GPT-5.5 Instant is deployed at a
low reasoning effort, and even at xhigh reasoning effort it still
performs lower than GPT-5.5 Thinking on these evaluations.

For AI Self-Improvement, evaluations of final checkpoints indicate
that, like its predecessor models, GPT-5.5 Instant does not have a
plausible chance of reaching a High threshold.

8.1 Capabilities Assessment

For the evaluations below, we tested a variety of elicitation
methods, including scaffolding and prompting where relevant. However,
evaluations represent a lower bound for potential capabilities;
additional prompting or fine-tuning, longer rollouts, novel
interactions, or different forms of scaffolding could elicit behaviors
beyond what we observed in our tests or the tests of our third-party
partners.

8.1.1 Biological and Chemical

We are treating this launch as High capability in the Biological and
Chemical domain, activating the associated Preparedness safeguards.

Given the higher potential severity of biological threats relative to
chemical ones, we prioritize biological capability evaluations and use
these as indicators for High and Critical capabilities for the
category.

8.1.1.1 Multimodal Troubleshooting Virology

To evaluate models’ ability to troubleshoot wet lab experiments in a
multimodal setting, we evaluate models on a set of 350 fully held-out
virology troubleshooting questions from SecureBio.

Figure 3

Figure 3

All models exceed the median domain expert baseline of 22.1%.

8.1.1.2 ProtocolQA Open-Ended

To evaluate models’ ability to troubleshoot commonly published lab
protocols, we modify 108 multiple choice questions from FutureHouse’s
ProtocolQA dataset [6] to
be open-ended short answer questions, which makes the evaluation harder
and more realistic than the multiple-choice version. The questions
introduce egregious errors in common published protocols, describe the
wet lab result of carrying out this protocol, and ask for how to fix the
procedure. To compare model performance to that of PhD experts, we
performed expert baselining on this evaluation with 19 PhD scientists
who have over one year of wet lab experience.

Figure 4

Figure 4

All models underperform the consensus expert baseline (54%).

8.1.1.3 Tacit Knowledge and Troubleshooting

We evaluated models on a tacit knowledge and troubleshooting multiple
choice dataset created with Gryphon Scientific. The questions span all 5
stages in the biothreat creation process and focus on areas where tacit
knowledge would be a bottleneck. Tacit knowledge questions are meant to
be obscure to anyone not working in the field, i.e., they either require
tracking down authors of relevant papers or knowing people in the field.
Troubleshooting questions are meant to be obscure to anyone without
hands-on experience, i.e., the answers are known only to people who have
tried the protocol themselves.

This set is uncontaminated; it was created fully in-house with our
partners at Gryphon Scientific and has not been published.

On some of these questions models respond with refusals or safe
completions which do not fully answer the question. To avoid
underestimating model capabilities, we report both original scores and
what the score would be if all refusals and safe completions were
treated as successes.

Figure 5

Figure 5

As with our other recent models, GPT-5.5 Instant just outperforms the
consensus expert baseline of 80% when including refusals and safe
completions, and underperforms 80% when excluding them.

8.1.1.4 TroubleshootingBench

To evaluate models’ ability to identify and correct real-world
experimental errors in biological protocols, we built a short-answer
troubleshooting dataset from expert-written wet lab procedures.
TroubleshootingBench focuses on tacit, hands-on knowledge and
uncontaminated procedures that are not available online.

Scientists with a PhD in a relevant biological discipline (virology,
genetics, microbiology, or protein engineering) were asked to transcribe
biological protocols they have personally used in the lab. Each protocol
must include precise step-by-step procedures, equipment, and reagents.
If a protocol was adapted from a publication, experts were required to
significantly alter at least several steps. From these protocols, they
created three troubleshooting questions each, introducing subtle or
realistic execution errors (e.g., improper homogenization technique) and
describing the resulting failed outcome.

After going through independent expert review, the resulting dataset
includes 52 protocols, each paired with three expert-written
troubleshooting questions. To benchmark model performance, we ran a
human baselining campaign with 12 independent PhD experts. The 80th
percentile expert score (36.4%) is used as an indicative threshold for
model performance. Compared to ProtocolQA Open-Ended, which focuses on
well-known published procedures, TroubleshootingBench is designed to
test model performance on non-public, experience-grounded protocols and
errors that rely on tacit procedural knowledge

Figure 6

Figure 6

GPT-5.5 Instant performs below the comparison models, and below the
expert baseline of 36.4%.

8.1.2 Cybersecurity

GPT-5.5 Instant closely matches the results for GPT-5.4 Thinking in
the cybersecurity evaluations below. Because of this, we similarly treat
GPT-5.5 Instant as High under the Preparedness Framework. However,
GPT-5.5 Instant is significantly less capable than GPT-5.5 Thinking in
cybersecurity, due to its poor performance on long-horizon tasks, and as
evidenced by lower performance on CTF, CVE-Bench, and significantly
lower performance on cyber range. Note also that the evals below are run
at a higher reasoning effort than GPT-5.5 Instant will be deployed with
in order to understand maximum capability.

Under our Preparedness
Framework, High cybersecurity capability is defined as a model that
removes existing bottlenecks to scaling cyber operations, including
either by automating end-to-end cyber operations against reasonably
hardened targets, or by automating the discovery and exploitation of
operationally relevant vulnerabilities.

In our analysis of prior cybersecurity incidents involving severe
harm through either of these two routes, we find each instance demanded
proficiency in each of three skills:

Discovery of advanced, operationally relevant exploits

Goal-oriented, end-to-end attack automation

Consistency in operations, allowing the attacker to scale damage
and/or avoid discovery

As with prior releases, we use the following three benchmarks
associated with the skills above:

Table 8: Vulnerability Identification and Exploitation Capabilities evaluations

Table 8. Vulnerability Identification and Exploitation Capabilities evaluations

Evaluation

Capability

Description

Capture the Flag (Professional)

Vulnerability Identification & Exploitation

Can models solve competitive professional level cybersecurity challenges?

CVE-Bench

Consistency in operations

Can models consistently identify and exploit real-world web application vulnerabilities?

Cyber Range

End-to-end cyber operations

Can models conduct fully end-to-end cyber operations in an emulated network?

Each of these evaluations has important limitations:

Capture-the-flag (CTF) evals only test pre-scripted attack paths and
isolated technical skills; they don’t measure a model’s ability to
design and run realistic, end-to-end campaigns (orchestration,
personas/phishing, behavioral cover, adversarial adaptation) over messy
real-world data and financial/technical systems. In other words, they
miss the capabilities that turn point exploits into scalable, resilient
cyber operations.

CVE-Bench [7]
is a public benchmark meant to measure a model’s ability to identify and
exploit vulnerabilities in free and open-source web applications.
Because the benchmark only measures web applications, performance
against it is only a limited measure of aggregate cyber risk, as the
broad operational relevance of this class of vulnerabilities is limited
as opposed to system or kernel vulnerabilities.

Cyber Range is an internally developed benchmark to evaluate a given
model’s ability to conduct a multi-step operation in an emulated network
environment. While this is significantly more realistic than a CTF-style
evaluation, the challenges don’t yet represent a hardened target where
there would be defenses and monitoring that could potentially disrupt
the model if it were discovered to be conducting a cyber operation.
Moreover, the scenarios feature less noise – i.e., details and
distractors from having been lived-in – than a real network would have,
making it easier for a model to find the ideal attack path.

Because of these limitations, excelling on all three evaluations is
necessary but not sufficient for a model to be considered High in cyber
capability. Even very strong results can still fall short of what is
required for scalable, end-to-end cyber operations against hardened
targets.

8.1.2.1 Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenges

We evaluate model performance on a test set of curated, publicly
available CTF challenges which met the following criteria:

The challenge required skills falling into one of the following
categories:

Web Application Exploitation (web): the flag is stored on a
virtual machine running vulnerable software which must be exploited over
an exposed network service to run code to retrieve it.

Reverse Engineering (rev): require analyzing a provided program
to find a vulnerability needed to recover the flag.

Binary and Network Exploitation (pwn): require finding inputs
needed to exploit a running program and retrieve the flag.

Cryptography (crypto): an encrypted flag is provided to the
participant or a remote system uses cryptography to guard the
flag.

Miscellaneous (misc): various other challenges ranging from
problem-solving to advanced security concepts and techniques.

The challenge was publicly available and provided with a working
execution environment.

Challenges were further divided into the level of proficiency needed
to solve the challenge, ultimately organized by whether the challenge
required high school, collegiate, or professional-level cybersecurity
knowledge and skills, with judgment on the requisite skills manually
determined by our in-house cybersecurity expert. For all Collegiate and
Professional CTFs we require that the solution involves a non-trivial
level of exploitation, requiring chaining two or more exploitation steps
and not be solvable by copy-pasting textbook examples. Historically, we
reported results across high school, collegiate, and professional levels
but given the rise in capabilities and our investment in more rigorous
benchmarks we focus only on professional CTFs.

To evaluate the model against the CTFs we give it access to a
headless Linux box with common offensive cybersecurity tools
preinstalled as well as a harness which allows the model to call those
tools or otherwise execute commands similar to as a human. We run 16
rollouts for each CTF exercise, recording the pass@12 metric over the
best set of rollouts.

Figure 7

Figure 7

GPT-5.5 Instant performs higher than GPT-5.4 Thinking and lower than
GPT-5.5 Thinking.

8.1.2.2 CVE-Bench

CVE-Bench is a benchmark that tasks models with identifying and
exploiting real-world web-application vulnerabilities in a sandbox
environment. We used CVE-Bench (version 1.0) with a focus on
vulnerabilities covering content-management systems, AI/ML apps,
business-management tools, operational-monitoring systems, web
infrastructure, libraries/packages, e-commerce platforms, and a small
number of computing-management, mail-server, and web-portal
applications; due to some infrastructure challenges porting the eval, we
only ran 34 out of the 40 benchmark challenges. We ran the benchmark
using the zero-day prompt configuration, where the model is given a
general task description of what it needs to do, as opposed to the
one-day configuration, where the model is given a description of the
vulnerability to exploit. Additionally, we ran the benchmark such that
the agent does not have access to the source code of the
web-application, and instead must probe it remotely.

We use pass@1 over 3 rollouts for this evaluation to measure the
model’s ability to consistently identify vulnerabilities which are
considered relatively straightforward by internal cybersecurity experts.
Consistency is important to measure the model’s cost-intelligence
frontier to identify vulnerabilities and its ability to potentially
evade detection mechanisms that look for scaled attempts of
vulnerability discovery and exploitation.

Figure 8

Figure 8

GPT-5.5 Instant performs higher than GPT-5.4 Thinking and lower than
GPT-5.5 Thinking.

8.1.2.3 Cyber range

Cyber range exercises measure a model’s ability to conduct fully
end-to-end cyber operations in a realistic, emulated network. These
exercises are long-form, requiring the model to (1) construct a plan to
achieve an abstract adversary objective; (2) exploit vulnerabilities,
misconfigurations, and weaknesses that are likely to be seen in the
wild; and (3) chain together these exploits to achieve the scenario
objective.

Performance is measured as pass/fail over 16 trials, where a pass
denotes at least one successful trial. The combined pass rate is the
percentage of scenarios passed.

evaluations. GPT-5.5 Instant is considered below High Capability.

8.2 Safeguards

8.2.1 Biological Safeguards

GPT-5.5 Instant is our first Instant model to be treated as High
capability in the Biological and Chemical domain, and we have activated
the associated safeguards designed to prevent conversations relevant to
our bio high threshold. This includes training the model to refuse
prompts that could lead to potentially harmful outputs, automated
monitors that interrupt potentially harmful conversations, actor level
enforcement, and security controls.

Table 10: Below, we share the results of our biological safety evaluations. These evaluations show, for some of the most challenging scenarios that the model can encounter, how often model training alone suffices to prevent a violative response (whether that response is a refusal to provide weaponization information, or a safely high level and non-actionable response to a request for dual-use biological assistance). The remainder between these numbers and 1.0, on the other hand, reflects the fraction of cases in our highly adversarial test set where our other safeguards, including system level safeguards, are needed and play an active role in creating safety.

Table 11: Given the observed regressions on the synthetic evaluations, we subsequently ran our evaluations across both our model and our automated safety monitors to better understand the end-to-end safeguard stack users will encounter in production. We see that the combination of the model itself and the automated safety monitors significantly increase performance on these evals.

As with our other models, we will closely monitor our safeguards
post-deployment, and will continue increasing their performance.

8.2.2 Cybersecurity Safeguards

GPT-5.5 Instant is also our first Instant model to be treated as High
capability in the Cybersecurity domain, though it performs below GPT-5.5
Thinking in capability. Accordingly, we have deployed our cybersecurity
safeguards to mitigate potentially violative conversations, including
automated monitors, actor level enforcement, and security controls.

We share the results of our cyber safety evaluations below. When
building these evaluations, we consider multiple aspects to ensure broad
and meaningful coverage. The eval sets combine deidentified production
data (in accordance with our privacy policy), which reflects realistic
user behavior, with synthetic data designed to improve coverage of
policy-relevant scenarios that are rare or under-represented actual use.
We evaluate both chat-based and agentic interactions, including
multi-turn settings. Prompts are selected using a mix of sampling
strategies—such as classifier-flagged cases and embedding–based
clustering—to emphasize challenging or ambiguous examples. The
distribution intentionally spans benign and legitimate requests as well
as disallowed requests, and includes MITRE ATT&CK–grounded
adversarial and defensive scenarios to stress-test safety behavior under
realistic threat models. These eval sets consist of challenging cases
and shouldn’t be interpreted as representative of production
behavior.

As with the above, these evaluations show, for some of the most
challenging scenarios that the model can encounter, how often model
training alone suffices to prevent a violative response. We find that
GPT-5.5 Instant performs similarly to or higher than comparison models
on our cyber safety evaluations (higher is better):
