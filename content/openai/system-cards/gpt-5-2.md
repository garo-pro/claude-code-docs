Title: Update to GPT-5 System Card: GPT-5.2 - OpenAI Deployment Safety Hub

URL Source: https://deploymentsafety.openai.com/gpt-5-2

Markdown Content:
GPT-5.2 is the latest model family in the GPT-5 series, and explained
in our blog.
The comprehensive safety mitigation approach for these models is largely
the same as that described in the GPT-5 System Card
and GPT-5.1
System Card.

In this card we also refer to GPT-5.2 Instant as gpt-5.2-instant and
GPT-5.2 Thinking as gpt-5.2-thinking.

2. Model Data and Training

Like OpenAI’s other models, the GPT-5.2 models were trained on
diverse datasets, including information that is publicly available on
the internet, information that we partner with third parties to access,
and information that our users or human trainers and researchers provide
or generate. Our data processing pipeline includes rigorous filtering to
maintain data quality and mitigate potential risks. We use advanced data
filtering processes to reduce personal information from training data.
We also employ safety classifiers to help prevent or reduce the use of
harmful or sensitive content, including explicit materials such as
sexual content involving a minor.

OpenAI reasoning models are trained to reason through reinforcement
learning. These models are trained to think before they answer: they can
produce a long internal chain of thought before responding to the user.
Through training, these models learn to refine their thinking process,
try different strategies, and recognize their mistakes. Reasoning allows
these models to follow specific guidelines and model policies we’ve set,
helping them act in line with our safety expectations. This means they
provide more helpful answers and better resist attempts to bypass safety
rules.

Note that comparison values from previously-launched models are from
the latest versions of those models, so may vary slightly from values
published at launch for those models.

3. Baseline Model Safety Evaluations

3.1 Disallowed Content Evaluations

We conducted benchmark evaluations across disallowed content
categories. We report here on our Production Benchmarks, an evaluation
set with conversations representative of challenging examples from
production data. As we noted in previous system cards, we introduced
these Production Benchmarks to help us measure continuing progress given
that our earlier Standard evaluations for these categories had become
relatively saturated.

These evaluations were deliberately created to be difficult. They
were built around cases in which our existing models were not yet giving
ideal responses, and this is reflected in the scores below. Error rates
are not representative of average production traffic. The primary metric
is not_unsafe, checking that the model did not produce output that is
disallowed under the relevant OpenAI policy.

Table 1: Production Benchmarks (higher is better)

Category

Values from previously-launched models are from the latest versions
of those models, and evals are subject to some variation. Values may
vary slightly from values published at launch for those models.

gpt-5.2-thinking and gpt-5.2-instant generally perform on par with or
better than gpt-5.1-thinking and gpt-5.1-instant. They especially
improve on Suicide/Self-Harm, Mental Health, and Emotional Reliance
offline evals, which were lower for GPT-5.1 (see GPT-5.1
system card).

Additionally, we have observed through internal testing that GPT-5.2
Instant generally refuses fewer requests for mature content,
specifically sexualized text output. Our testing suggests that this does
not impact other types of disallowed sexual content or content involving
minors.

We’ve found that this does not materially impact users whom we know
to be minors, for whom our preexisting safeguards appear to be working
well. For these users, we apply additional content protections that
reduce access to sensitive content including violence, gore, viral
challenges, sexual, romantic, or violent role play and extreme beauty
standards. We are in the early stages of rolling out our age prediction
model so that we can automatically apply these protections to accounts
for users we believe to be under 18. We will continue to share
progress.

For other users, we have deployed system-level safeguards in ChatGPT
intended to mitigate this behavior. Our automated and manual testing
suggest that these additional safeguards help to mitigate the issue.

We are continuing to improve our safeguards in this area and these
learnings will inform any future releases.

3.2 Jailbreaks

We evaluate the robustness of models to jailbreaks: adversarial
prompts that purposely try to circumvent model refusals for content it’s
not supposed to produce.

Below is an adaptation of the academic jailbreak eval, StrongReject
[1]. This
eval inserts a known jailbreak into an example from disallowed content
evaluations. We then run it through the same policy graders we use for
disallowed content checks. We test jailbreak techniques on base prompts
across harm categories, and evaluate for not_unsafe according to
relevant policy. Note we filtered the original set of StrongReject
examples to remove examples where all our models including older 4o were
consistently safe, as it was otherwise highly saturated.

Table 2: StrongReject filtered (higher is better)

Category

We find that gpt-5.2-thinking performs better than
gpt-5.1-thinking.

gpt-5.2-instant performs lower than gpt-5.1-instant, though it still
performs higher than gpt-5-instant-oct3 (as reported in GPT-5.1
system card addendum). Upon investigation, some of the errors are
due to grader issues, and the remainder appear to be a regression in
some cases under the illicit category, which we will investigate for
future updates.

3.3 Prompt Injection

We evaluate the model’s robustness to known prompt injection attacks
against connectors and function-calling. These attacks embed adversarial
instructions in the tool-output that aim to mislead the model and
override the system/developer/user instruction. Both of these
evaluations are splits of the data we used for training, so don’t
represent a model’s ability to generalize to new attacks. The two eval
sets we have are:

Agent JSK: prompt injection attacks inserted into simulated email
connectors.

PlugInject: prompt injection attacks inserted into function
calls.

Table 3: Prompt Injection

Category

Both gpt-5.2-instant and gpt-5.2-thinking show significant
improvements on these evaluations, essentially saturating these evals.
As with any adversarial space, these evaluations overrepresent
robustness as we are only able to evaluate against the attacks we know
about; even so, we observe these models to be strongly robust to known
attacks.

3.4 Vision

We ran the image input evaluations introduced with ChatGPT agent,
that evaluate for not_unsafe model output, given disallowed combined
text and image input.

Table 4: Image input evaluations, with metric not_unsafe (higher is better)

Category

We find that both the instant and thinking variations of GPT-5.2
perform generally on par with their predecessors. We manually examined
the failures for the vision self-harm eval, and found false positives
due to grader issues; upon manual investigation, the model meets safety
launch requirements and grader issues will be addressed in a future
iteration.

3.5 Hallucinations

To evaluate our models’ ability to provide factually correct
responses, we measure the rate of factual hallucinations on prompts
representative of real ChatGPT production conversations. We use an
LLM-based grading model with web access to identify factual errors in
the assistant’s responses to these prompts and report both the
percentage of claims across responses that are identified as having a
factual error as well as the percentage of responses containing at least
one major factual error. We find that GPT-5.2 Thinking performs on par
with (or slightly better) than its predecessors in this setting.

Figure 1

Figure 1

Figure 2

Figure 2

To understand how factuality varies by topic, we additionally use an
LLM-based classifier to identify subsets of prompts that cover specific
factuality-relevant domains: business and marketing research, financial
and tax, legal and regulatory, reviewing and developing academic essays,
and current events and news. GPT-5.2 Thinking performs especially well
with browsing enabled, achieving <1% hallucination rate across all 5
domains.

3.6 Health

Chatbots can empower consumers to better understand their health and
help health professionals deliver better care [2][3]. We evaluate GPT-5.2
on HealthBench [4], an evaluation of health
performance and safety. HealthBench comprises 5,000 examples with
(potentially multi-turn) conversations between chatbots and either
consumers or health professionals. Model responses are evaluated with
example-specific rubrics. We report results on three variants,
HealthBench, HealthBench Hard, and HealthBench Consensus.

Table 5: HealthBench

Category

In the table above, we observe that GPT-5.2 models perform similarly
to their respective GPT-5.1 models in health performance and safety.

3.7 Deception

Deception – when the model’s user‑facing response misrepresents its
internal reasoning or the actions it took – can arise in a variety of
circumstances. We evaluate GPT-5.2 Thinking on a set of prompts
representative of traffic that previously elicited deception in ChatGPT.
In addition, we use a modified version of the multimodal CharXiv
benchmark [5],
in which all of the images are removed and measure whether the model
attempts an answer. We take a similar approach by posing questions that
require browsing, but each call to the browsing tool returns an error,
and in a set of agentic coding tasks designed to be impossible.

While deception previously likely to occur in production traffic
decreased, we observed elevated failures in some specific domains. We
initially found that GPT-5.2 Thinking, in the face of missing images,
was more willing to hallucinate answers than previous models. However,
upon closer inspection we found that this was partly driven by some
prompts having strict output requirements (e.g., “Only output an
integer”). Thus, when posed with a tension between instruction following
and abstention, the model prioritized stricter instruction
following.

Similarly, on a subset of the coding deception benchmark where the
task given to the model doesn’t match the codebase it’s operating in,
GPT-5.2 Thinking tended to attempt to implement the entire codebase from
scratch. While this was not intended behavior, it is arguably benign, as
the model made a good faith attempt to follow the user’s request, rather
than falsely claiming success without trying.

In real production traffic, GPT-5.2 Thinking was deceptive 1.6% of
the time, significantly lower than GPT-5.1 and slightly lower than
GPT-5. These numbers are based on running reasoning based chain of
thought monitors over large samples of pre-release AB-test traffic.
Categories of deception include among others: lying about what tools
returned or what tools were run, fabricating facts or citations, being
overconfident in the final answer compared to internal reasoning, reward
hacking and claiming to do work in the background when no work was
occurring.

Robustly aligning advanced AI systems is an open research question
and there are many potential trade offs, including how strictly to
prioritize instruction following over other alignment considerations. As
we continue to improve alignment techniques, we aim to transparently
communicate any residual idiosyncrasies.

3.8 Cyber Safety

We trained gpt-5.2-thinking integrations to provide maximally helpful
support on educational/cybersecurity topics while refusing or
de-escalating operational guidance for cyber abuse, including areas such
as malware creation, credential theft, and chained exploitation. We
assess performance on data that do not overlap with the training set,
measuring policy compliance rate (higher is better).

Table 7: Cyber safety evaluations

Category

Overall, we observe significant improvements in policy compliance
rate for gpt-5.2-thinking compared to gpt-5.1-thinking and
gpt-5-thinking.

We saw no meaningful regression in capability evaluations. We observe
minimal regression in concreteness on benign cyber requests, as well as
a small drop in concreteness for high risk dual use cyber requests.

3.9 Multilingual Performance

To evaluate the models’ multilingual capabilities, we used
professional human translators to translate MMLU’s test set into
different languages. We find that gpt-5.2-thinking performs generally on
par with gpt-5-thinking.

Table 8: MMLU Language (0-shot, higher is better)

Category

These results were achieved through 0-shot, chain-of-thought
prompting of the model. The answers were parsed from the model’s
response by a grader model.

3.10 Bias

We also tested the models on our first-person fairness evaluation
[6]. This
evaluation consists of multiturn conversations, starting with a prompt
in which a user shares their name such as “Hi, I’m [NAME].” to which the
model responds “Hi [NAME]! How can I assist you today?” We then prompt
the model with a request such as “Write a fairytale.”

This evaluation is used to assess harmful stereotypes by grading
differences in how a model responds to the conversation when the user’s
name is statistically more often associated with males (e.g., Brian) or
females (e.g., Ashley). Responses are rated for harmful differences in
stereotypes using GPT-4o, whose ratings were shown to be consistent with
human ratings. This evaluation consists of over 600 challenging prompts
reflecting real-world scenarios that exhibit high rates of bias in
GPT-4o-mini generations. These prompts were intentionally chosen to be
an order of magnitude more difficult than standard production traffic;
this means that in typical use, we expect our models to be about ten
times less biased.

We report the metric harm_overall, which represents our expected
difference of biased answers for male vs female names based on the
performance on this evaluation (i.e., performance on the evaluation
divided by 10). We see gpt-5.2-thinking performs generally on par with
gpt-5.1-thinking.

4. Chain of Thought Evaluations

This section was added on April 24, 2026.

4.1 CoT Monitorability

We evaluate chain-of-thought (CoT) monitorability: whether a monitor
can infer safety-relevant properties of a model’s behavior from its
reasoning trace. There are principled reasons to
believe[7] that CoT can provide a
substantially richer monitoring signal than actions and final outputs
alone, a hypothesis that is supported by growing empiricalevidence.
We assess GPT-5.2 Thinking using the evaluation suite from Guan et al. (2025)[8],
which spans 13 evaluations across 24 environments and three evaluation
archetypes—intervention, process, and outcome-property. We summarize
performance with g-mean², a metric that depends on both true positive
rate (TPR) and true negative rate (TNR), using a cross-fit
filtering strategy that makes intervention-style estimates more
robust to noise-dominated instances.

Figure 5 reports
aggregate monitorability, TPR, and TNR as a function of CoT length and
compares monitors when given access to different observations of the
agent’s rollout: only the agent’s chain of thought (CoT only), only
actions or final outputs to the user (action only), and all tokens
generated by the agent (all messages). The monitor model used is GPT-5
Thinking. As in Guan et al.
(2025)[8], monitorability
generally improves as models produce longer CoTs, and monitors that can
inspect CoT or all messages are substantially more informative than
monitors limited to actions alone. Averaging these evaluations, GPT-5.2
Thinking has somewhat lower aggregate CoT monitorability than GPT-5
Thinking. Figure 6,
which plots CoT-only monitoring at medium reasoning effort broken down
by environment groups. It shows that Memory and Sandbagging were the
environment groups with substantial regressions. Meanwhile, GPT-5.2
Thinking has increased monitorability on Health Queries: Patient
Opinion.

We see from Figure 7 that the regression in
Memory is driven by a large drop in TNR in the intervention arm. We
manually inspected the intervention-arm false positive samples among
eligible instances. In many cases, the sampling model’s CoTs explicitly
referenced and appeared to use the hint, and the monitor flagged those
traces accordingly. These samples were counted as false positives
because the final answers were not judged by the answer grader to be
biased by the memory. The effect on the final answer was often subtle,
and this particular eval relies on model grading for the output outcome,
rather than determining it programmatically. Overall, this suggests a
substantial part of the measured regression may come from mismatch
between reasoning-level hint use and the output-level Y label, though we
cannot fully rule out cases where the model overstates hint use in its
CoT. If the former is the main driver, then this reflects a limitation
of these evals: the intervention can be used in reasoning (X=1, Z=1)
without producing an output-level change (Y=0).

We see from Figure 8 that the regression
in sandbagging is driven by a large drop in TPR. We inspected false
negatives (X=1, Y=1, Z=0) among eligible instances and the samples
appeared to be genuine cases of unmonitorable sandbagging. For example,
the model CoT clearly states it should not use the hint, but the model
is distributionally more likely to choose a wrong answer.

It is also notable that on both of the two regressed evals, Memory
and Sandbagging, the CoT lengths are notably shorter in GPT-5.2 Thinking
compared to GPT-5 Thinking, while across the entire eval suite
(Figure 5), the CoT
lengths are comparable for the two models.

We plan to refine our evaluations and further investigate the sources
of the regressions. We also plan to explore mitigations that preserve
monitorability as models improve. More broadly, this result reinforces
the fragility of CoT monitorability (Korbak, et al., 2025[7]) and
the importance of tracking and preserving it so that CoT monitoring can
remain a useful component of scalable oversight.

4.2 CoT Controllability

We measure GPT-5.2 Thinking’s controllability by running CoT-Control,
an evaluation suite described in (Yueh-Han,
2026[9]) that
tracks the model’s ability to follow user instructions about their CoT.
Because controllability is heavily confounded by CoT length (longer CoTs
are hardest to control, all else equal; see Yueh-Han,
2026[9], sec. 5.3),
we report controllability scores as a function of CoT length. We find
that while GPT-5.2 Thinking’s controllability is relatively high for
short CoTs (up to 1000 tokens), it becomes lower than GPT-5 Thinking’s
and GPT-5.1 Thinking’s for longer CoTs.

5. Preparedness Framework

The Preparedness
Framework is OpenAI’s approach to tracking and preparing for
frontier capabilities that create new risks of severe harm. The
framework commits us to track and mitigate the risk of severe harm,
including by implementing safeguards that sufficiently minimize the risk
for highly capable models.

As we did for gpt-5.1-thinking and gpt-5-thinking before it, we are
continuing to treat gpt-5.2-thinking as High capability in the
Biological and Chemical domain. We have applied the corresponding
safeguards for this model as described in the GPT-5 system
card.

For cybersecurity and AI self-improvement, evaluations of final
checkpoints indicate that, like their predecessor models, GPT-5.2 models
do not have a plausible chance of reaching a High threshold.

5.1 Capabilities Assessment

For the evaluations below, we tested a variety of elicitation
methods, including scaffolding and prompting where relevant. However,
evaluations represent a lower bound for potential capabilities;
additional prompting or fine-tuning, longer rollouts, novel
interactions, or different forms of scaffolding could elicit behaviors
beyond what we observed in our tests or the tests of our third-party
partners.

We calculate 95% confidence intervals for pass@1 using a standard
bootstrap procedure that resamples model attempts per problem to
approximate the metric’s distribution. While widely used, this method
can underestimate uncertainty for very small datasets, as it captures
only sampling variance (randomness in the model’s performance on the
same problems across multiple attempts) rather than all problem-level
variance (variation in problem difficulty or pass rates). This can lead
to overly tight confidence intervals, especially when a problem’s pass
rate is near 0% or 100% with few attempts. We report these confidence
intervals to reflect the inherent variation in evaluation results.

5.1.1 Biological and Chemical

We are treating this launch as High capability in the Biological and
Chemical domain, activating the associated Preparedness safeguards. We
do not have definitive evidence that these models could meaningfully
help a novice to create severe biological harm, our defined threshold
for High capability, and these models remain on the cusp of being able
to reach this capability. Given the higher potential severity of
biological threats relative to chemical ones, we prioritize biological
capability evaluations and use these as indicators for High and Critical
capabilities for the category.

5.1.1.1 Multimodal Troubleshooting Virology

To evaluate models’ ability to troubleshoot wet lab experiments in a
multimodal setting, we evaluate models on a set of 350 fully held-out
virology troubleshooting questions from SecureBio.

Figure 10

Figure 10

All models exceed the median domain expert baseline of 22.1%.

5.1.1.2 ProtocolQA Open-Ended

To evaluate models’ ability to troubleshoot commonly published lab
protocols, we modify 108 multiple choice questions from FutureHouse’s
ProtocolQA dataset [10] to
be open-ended short answer questions, which makes the evaluation harder
and more realistic than the multiple-choice version. The questions
introduce egregious errors in common published protocols, describe the
wet lab result of carrying out this protocol, and ask for how to fix the
procedure. To compare model performance to that of PhD experts, we
performed expert baselining on this evaluation with 19 PhD scientists
who have over one year of wet lab experience.

Figure 11

Figure 11

All models underperform the consensus expert baseline (54%) and the
median expert baseline of 42%. To run this eval with browsing, we
maintain a domain blocklist and filter out any browsing results to sites
on the blocklist. We also inspect browsing rollouts using a classifier
which flags instances of cheating and manually review all flagged
rollouts.

5.1.1.3 Tacit Knowledge and Troubleshooting

We evaluated models on a tacit knowledge and troubleshooting multiple
choice dataset created with Gryphon Scientific. The questions span all 5
stages in the biothreat creation process and focus on areas where tacit
knowledge would be a bottleneck. Tacit knowledge questions are meant to
be obscure to anyone not working in the field, i.e., they either require
tracking down authors of relevant papers or knowing people in the field.
Troubleshooting questions are meant to be obscure to anyone without
hands-on experience, i.e., the answers are known only to people who have
tried the protocol themselves.

This set is uncontaminated; it was created fully in-house with our
partners at Gryphon Scientific and has not been published.

Figure 12

Figure 12

None of the tested models outperform the consensus expert baseline of
80%, though all models outperform the 80th percentile PhD expert
baseline of 63%. gpt-5.2-thinking performs lower than prior models due
to increased refusals. If we treat all refusals as passes,
gpt-5.2-thinking scores 83.33% on this evaluation.

5.1.1.4 TroubleshootingBench

To evaluate models’ ability to identify and correct real-world
experimental errors in biological protocols, we built a short-answer
troubleshooting dataset from expert-written wet lab procedures.
TroubleshootingBench focuses on tacit, hands-on knowledge and
uncontaminated procedures that are not available online.

Scientists with a PhD in a relevant biological discipline (virology,
genetics, microbiology, or protein engineering) were asked to transcribe
biological protocols they have personally used in the lab. Each protocol
must include precise step-by-step procedures, equipment, and reagents.
If a protocol was adapted from a publication, experts were required to
significantly alter at least several steps. From these protocols, they
created three troubleshooting questions each, introducing subtle or
realistic execution errors (e.g., improper homogenization technique) and
describing the resulting failed outcome.

After going through independent expert review, the resulting dataset
includes 52 protocols, each paired with three expert-written
troubleshooting questions. To benchmark model performance, we ran a
human baselining campaign with 12 independent PhD experts. The 80th
percentile expert score (36.4%) is used as an indicative threshold for
model performance. Compared to ProtocolQA Open-Ended, which focuses on
well-known published procedures, TroubleshootingBench is designed to
test model performance on non-public, experience-grounded protocols and
errors that rely on tacit procedural knowledge

Figure 13

Figure 13

gpt-5.2-thinking scores highest on this evaluation without accounting
for refusals, 3 percentage points more than gpt-5.1-thinking.

5.1.2 Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity is focused on capabilities that could create risks
related to use of the model for cyber-exploitation to disrupt
confidentiality, integrity, and/or availability of computer systems. Our
internal results show that gpt-5.2-thinking performs considerably better
than gpt-5-thinking on our evaluations and is around a similar
capability level as gpt-5.1-codex-max. The gpt-5.2-thinking model series
does not meet the threshold for High cyber capability.

Under our Preparedness
Framework, High cybersecurity capability is defined as a model that
removes existing bottlenecks to scaling cyber operations, including
either by automating end-to-end cyber operations against reasonably
hardened targets, or by automating the discovery and exploitation of
operationally relevant vulnerabilities. Concretely, this means a model
qualifies as High if it can develop working zero-day remote exploits
against well-defended systems, or meaningfully assist with complex,
stealthy enterprise or industrial intrusion operations aimed at
real-world effects.In our analysis of prior cybersecurity incidents
involving severe harm through either of these two routes, we find each
instance demanded proficiency in each of three skills:

Discovery of advanced, operationally relevant exploits

Goal-oriented, end-to-end attack automation

Consistency in operations, allowing the attacker to scale damage
and/or avoid discovery

Capture the Flag (Professional)

Can models solve competitive high school, collegiate, and professional level cybersecurity challenges?

CVE-Bench

Consistency in operations

Can models consistently identify and exploit real-world web application vulnerabilities?

Cyber Range

Vulnerability Identification & Exploitation

Can models conduct fully end-to-end cyber operations in an emulated network?

Each of these evaluations has important limitations:

Capture-the-flag (CTF) evals only test pre-scripted attack paths and
isolated technical skills; they don’t measure a model’s ability to
design and run realistic, end-to-end campaigns (orchestration,
personas/phishing, behavioral cover, adversarial adaptation) over messy
real-world data and financial/technical systems. In other words, they
miss the capabilities that turn point exploits into scalable, resilient
cyber operations.

CVE-Bench [11]
is a public benchmark meant to measure a model’s ability to identify and
exploit vulnerabilities in free and open-source web applications.
Because the benchmark only measures web applications, performance
against it is only a limited measure of aggregate cyber risk, as the
broad operational relevance of this class of vulnerabilities is limited
as opposed to system or kernel vulnerabilities.

Cyber Range is an internally developed benchmark to evaluate a given
model’s ability to conduct a multi-step operation in an emulated network
environment. While this is significantly more realistic than a CTF-style
evaluation, the challenges don’t yet represent a hardened target where
there would be defenses and monitoring that could potentially disrupt
the model if it were discovered to be conducting a cyber operation.
Moreover, the scenarios feature less noise – i.e., details and
distractors from having been lived-in – than a real network would have,
making it easier for a model to find the ideal attack path.

Because of these limitations, excelling on all three evaluations is
necessary but not sufficient for a model to be considered High in cyber
capability. Even very strong results can still fall short of what is
required for scalable, end-to-end cyber operations against hardened
targets.

Given that we expect capabilities to continue to increase, we are
continuing to invest in safeguards, including both the model safety
training described above and scaling up our monitoring and enforcement
pipeline to disrupt potential misuse. We are also working on initiatives
to help defenders and strengthen cybersecurity safeguards, and we
continue to build and strengthen our cybersecurity evaluations. You can
read more about our approach to safeguards for models that reach High
levels of capability here.

5.1.2.1 Capture the Flag (CTF) Challenges

We evaluate model performance on a test set of curated, publicly
available CTF challenges which met the following criteria:

The challenge required skills falling into one of the following
categories:

Web Application Exploitation (web): the flag is stored on a
virtual machine running vulnerable software which must be exploited over
an exposed network service to run code to retrieve it.

Reverse Engineering (rev): require analyzing a provided program
to find a vulnerability needed to recover the flag.

Binary and Network Exploitation (pwn): require finding inputs
needed to exploit a running program and retrieve the flag.

Cryptography (crypto): an encrypted flag is provided to the
participant or a remote system uses cryptography to guard the
flag.

Miscellaneous (misc): various other challenges ranging from
problem-solving to advanced security concepts and techniques.

The challenge was publicly available and provided with a working
execution environment.

Challenges were further divided into the level of proficiency needed
to solve the challenge, ultimately organized by whether the challenge
required high school, collegiate, or professional-level cybersecurity
knowledge and skills, with judgment on the requisite skills manually
determined by our in-house cybersecurity expert. For all Collegiate and
Professional CTFs, we require that the solution involves a non-trivial
level of exploitation, requiring chaining two or more exploitation steps
and not be solvable by copy-pasting textbook examples. Historically, we
reported results across high school, collegiate, and professional levels
but given the rise in capabilities and our investment in more rigorous
benchmarks; we will focus on professional CTFs.

To evaluate the model against the CTFs, we give it access to a
headless Linux box with common offensive cybersecurity tools
preinstalled as well as a harness which allows the model to call those
tools or otherwise execute commands similar to as a human. We run 16
rollouts for each CTF exercise, recording the pass@12 metric over the
best set of rollouts; this metric is then compared to the thresholds
established by the Preparedness Framework as well as the performance of
previously released OpenAI models. While the performance is strong, it
does not reach our threshold for potentially High cyber capability.

Figure 14

Figure 14

As always, we note that these evaluation results likely represent
lower bounds on model capability, because additional scaffolding or
improved capability elicitation could substantially increase observed
performance.

5.1.2.2 CVE-Bench

CVE-Bench is a benchmark that tasks models with identifying and
exploiting real-world web-application vulnerabilities in a sandbox
environment. We used CVE-Bench (version 1.0) with a focus on
vulnerabilities covering content-management systems, AI/ML apps,
business-management tools, operational-monitoring systems, web
infrastructure, libraries/packages, e-commerce platforms, and a small
number of computing-management, mail-server, and web-portal
applications; due to some infrastructure porting challenges, we only ran
34 out of the 40 benchmark challenges. We ran the benchmark using the
zero-day prompt configuration, where the model is given a general task
description of what it needs to do, as opposed to the one-day
configuration, where the model is given a description of the
vulnerability to exploit. Additionally, we ran the benchmark such that
the agent does not have access to the source code of the
web-application, and instead must probe it remotely.

We use pass@1 for this evaluation to measure the model’s ability to
consistently identify vulnerabilities which are considered relatively
straightforward by internal cybersecurity experts. Consistency is
important to measure the model’s cost-intelligence frontier to identify
vulnerabilities and its ability to potentially evade detection
mechanisms that look for scaled attempts of vulnerability discovery and
exploitation.

gpt-5.2-thinking performs 8 percentage points better than
gpt-5.1-thinking, but 11 percentage points worse than gpt-5.1-codex-max,
which has the ability to extend its work across multiple context
windows.

5.1.2.3 Cyber Range

Cyber range exercises measure a model’s ability to conduct fully
end-to-end cyber operations in a realistic, emulated network.These
exercises are long-form, requiring the model to (1) construct a plan to
achieve an abstract adversary objective; (2) exploit vulnerabilities,
misconfigurations, and weaknesses that are likely to be seen in the
wild; and (3) chain together these exploits to achieve the scenario
objective.

Performance is measured as pass or fail over 16 trials, where a pass
denotes at least one success. Overall success rate is the percentage of
passed scenarios.

5.1.2.4 External Evaluations for Cyber Capabilities

External Evaluations by Irregular

Irregular, an AI Security organization that addresses and mitigates
frontier cybersecurity risks, evaluated the model’s ability to solve
three types of cyberoffensive challenges:

Vulnerability Research and Exploitation: Tests capabilities in
reverse engineering, code analysis, cryptography, and exploitation.

Network Attack Simulation: Assesses understanding and leveraging of
common attack flows, reconnaissance methods, and network protocols and
components like firewalls and file servers.

Evasion: Covers the ability to avoid detection by security controls
and monitoring systems.

As part of the test setting, the model has 1000 turns to interact
with each challenge, with elicitation techniques that aim to maximize
its capabilities. The model’s goal is to retrieve a secret flag. The
model runs on each challenge multiple times with measured success rates
and cost-per-success: The total cost of all runs divided by the number
of successful runs.

On the v1 atomic challenge suite, gpt-5.2-thinking achieved an
average success rate of 83% in Vulnerability Research and Exploitation,
100% in Network Attack Simulation challenges, and 73% in Evasion
challenges. For more details demonstrating the model’s capabilities on a
specific challenge, see Irregular’s "Cryptographic
Challenge Case Study" report.

In terms of API usage cost (assuming the same pricing as GPT-5) for
solved challenges, the average cost-per-success in Vulnerability
Research and Exploitation challenges is $10.8, the average
cost-per-success in Network Attack Simulation challenges is $3.7, and
the average cost-per-success in Evasion challenges is $12.9.

5.1.3 AI Self-Improvement

gpt-5.2-thinking performed at a similar capability level to
gpt-5.1-codex-max and did not meet our High thresholds. The High
capability threshold is defined to be equivalent to a performant
mid-career research engineer and performance in the evaluations below
indicate we can rule this out for gpt-5.2-thinking.

5.1.3.1 OpenAI PRs

Measuring if and when models can automate the job of an OpenAI
research engineer is a key goal of self-improvement evaluation work. We
test models on their ability to replicate pull request contributions by
OpenAI employees, which measures our progress towards this
capability.

We source tasks directly from internal OpenAI pull requests. A single
evaluation sample is based on an agentic rollout. In each rollout:

An agent’s code environment is checked out to a pre-PR branch of an
OpenAI repository and given a prompt describing the required
changes.

ChatGPT agent, using command-line tools and Python, modifies files
within the codebase.

The modifications are graded by a hidden unit test upon
completion.

If all task-specific tests pass, the rollout is considered a success.
The prompts, unit tests, and hints are human-written.

gpt-5.2-thinking is the highest performing model on this eval,
exceeding even gpt-5.1-codex-max.

5.1.3.2 MLE-Bench

Developed by the Preparedness team, MLE-bench evaluates an
agent’s ability to solve Kaggle challenges involving the design,
building, and training of machine learning models on GPUs. In this eval,
we provide an agent with a virtual environment, GPU, and data and
instruction set from Kaggle. The agent is then given 24 hours to develop
a solution, though we scale up to 100 hours in some experiments.

Figure 17

Figure 17

The full dataset consists of 75 hand-curated Kaggle competitions,
worth $1.9m in prize value. Measuring progress towards model
self-improvement is key to evaluating autonomous agents’ full potential.
We use MLE-bench to benchmark our progress towards model
self-improvement, in addition to general agentic capabilities. The
subset plotted below is 30 of the most interesting and diverse
competitions chosen from the subset of tasks that are <50GB and
<10h.

Outcome variable: bronze pass@1 or pass@n: in what %
of competitions a model can achieve at least a bronze medal

Example problem: Molecular
Translation – predict chemical identifiers from rotated images of
molecules

5.1.3.3 PaperBench

PaperBench[12] evaluates the
ability of AI agents to replicate state-of-the-art AI research. Agents
must replicate 20 ICML 2024 Spotlight and Oral papers from scratch,
including understanding paper contributions, developing a codebase, and
successfully executing experiments. For objective evaluation, we develop
rubrics that hierarchically decompose each replication task into smaller
sub-tasks with clear grading criteria. In total, PaperBench contains
8,316 individually gradable tasks.

We measure a 10-paper subset of the original PaperBench splits, where
each paper requires <10GB of external data files. We report pass@1
performance with high reasoning effort and no browsing.

gpt-5.2-thinking scores only one percentage point below
gpt-5.1-codex-max, our highest scoring model on this benchmark.

5.1.3.4 OPQA

OpenAI-Proof Q&A evaluates AI models on 20 internal research and
engineering bottlenecks encountered at OpenAI, each representing at
least a one-day delay to a major project and in some cases influencing
the outcome of large training runs and launches. “OpenAI-Proof” refers
to the fact that each problem required over a day for a team at OpenAI
to solve. Tasks require models to diagnose and explain complex
issues—such as unexpected performance regressions, anomalous training
metrics, or subtle implementation bugs. Models are given access to a
container with code access and run artifacts. Each solution is graded
pass@1.

gpt-5.1-codex-max remains the highest scoring model on this benchmark
at 8%.

5.2 Research Category Update: Sandbagging

External Evaluations by Apollo Research

Apollo Research conducted a full evaluation of gpt-5.2-thinking for
strategic deception, in-context scheming, and sabotage capabilities.
Across these assessments, Apollo found that gpt-5.2-thinking’s
capability and propensity for scheming are broadly comparable to other
recent frontier models, including gpt-5.1-thinking and
gpt-5.1-codex-max. gpt-5.2-thinking occasionally engages in deceptive
behaviors such as falsifying data, feigning task completion, or
strategically underperforming when given an explicit in-context goal,
but it shows low rates of covert subversion against developers and does
not engage in sabotage or self-preservation behaviors in these settings.
While gpt-5.2-thinking may exhibit higher awareness of being evaluated
than some prior OpenAI models, deception rates are generally similar to
peers and are not substantially amplified by scaffolding. In addition,
Apollo observed fewer linguistic anomalies in gpt-5.2-thinking’s
chain-of-thought compared to gpt-5.1-thinking. Based on these findings,
Apollo concludes that gpt-5.2-thinking is unlikely to be capable of
causing catastrophic harm via scheming.
